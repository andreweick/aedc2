we got ice cream tonight because they both had such a rough night and Libby is teething.  Libby still eats her ice cream cone from the bottom up.  It's much cleaner (at the start), but the she gets half way through and has a mess.  Jasmine says "ibby...messy!" and then she tries to give Libby a napkin, which frustrates her more.
