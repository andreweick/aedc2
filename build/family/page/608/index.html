Let me type into my mobile, and see…")  I must be old, because I totally don't get that.  If I am going out I'll either Call/SMS my friends and tell them where I am, or I'll simply "look around the bar" and see if I recognize anyone.   My friend Jason went to the show with me, and he said "Mobile applications are completely dead.  What we should be working on is making the mobile devices that have a real browser on them."  I totally agree with him.  I'd rather just use a quick web page that works well on my mobile, then install and mind another application on the client.  I have (and love) my Blackberry, and I used to have a windows mobile.  The browsers on both leave a lot to be desired.</p> <p>I didn't do well at the conference in networking with other developers.  I totally didn't use <a href="//www.twitter.com/AndrewEick">my twitter</a> correctly, and missed the opportunity to meet some of the people I have always wanted to chat with.  Perhaps the show is just to short!</p> <p>They just posted a page where you can <a href="//visitmix.com/blogs/Joshua/Get-the-Software-Tools-Featured-at-MIX08/">download all the MIX08 tools here</a>.  I tried to install SilverLight into my VisualStudio 2008 tonight and didn't do so well — Whatever you do don't hit 'cancel.'  In fact, they should have just change the 'cancel' button to a 'Press this button and totally mess up your machine" button – I probably would not have hit it then.  If you do hit the 'cancel' button, <a href="//weblogs.asp.net/bradleyb/archive/2008/03/06/installation-tips-for-sivliverlight-tools-beta-1-for-visual-studio-2008.aspx">this link</a> helped me get the beta installed.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="//www.thincsoft.com/">We've</a> been working a bunch with Silverlight so far, and I can't wait to dig into the new beta.  <a href="//www.nukeation.com">Dax</a> and I will have much <a href="//www.revoluxions.com">more to say</a> about the new tools in the weeks and months to come!</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Official MIX08 water bottle (This is for you <a href="//liamcassidy.net/">Liam</a>, airport security took the bottle I grabbed for you – the best I could do was grab the label…)</p> <p><img alt="" src="//media.eick.us/2011/05/2325782237_7d5e84ed85.jpg"/> </p> <p>I only took 1 picture in Vegas, how dumb was that?? </p> <p><a title="Las Vegas fountains by AndrewEick, on Flickr" href="//www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/2326598434/"><img alt="Las Vegas fountains" src="//media.eick.us/2011/05/2326598434_8e832d5285.jpg"/></a></p> <p> </p> <div class=wlWriterSmartContent style="padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: [MIX08](http://technorati.com/tags/MIX08)</div> </article> </li> </ul> </section> <ul class=pagination> <li class=prev> <a class=ss-navigateleft href="/family/page/607/">Prev</a> </li> <li class=next> <a class="ss-navigateright right" href="/family/page/609/">Next</a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
