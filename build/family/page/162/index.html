The pub dates back to Shakespearian time. (Well, in actual fact it was rebuilt. A fire destroyed it in 1676, so they had to rebuild it on the site). I shouldn't be surprised that the pub is there 10 years later, seeing as it's been there for over 300 years!</p> <p>There are many small rooms (maybe 10 tables and a fireplace) with bars in each of them, and a common courtyard in the middle of the tavern where the traveling showman used to stage plays. This is where Shakespeare would go and stage plays for the benefit of the drinkers. Shakespeare's globe theater, in fact, is two or three blocks down the Thames. Back then, the south bank of the river was the bad section of town (Where actors and playwrights would frequent), but now it is the middle of London. </p> <p>It took quite a walk to find the place from Westminster to Southbank (in that I really didn't remember where it was), but I found it by the tower bridge tube station down an alley between two buildings.</p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-01-25/IMG_3328-.jpg' title='The George Inn'/><figcaption>The George Inn</figcaption></figure></p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-01-25/IMG_3329-.jpg' title='The George Inn'/><figcaption>The George Inn</figcaption></figure></p> <p>In case I forget where it is for next time I'm in London, go to the London Bridge tube station, and …</p> <div id=mapviewer><iframe id=map name=mapFrame scrolling=no width=640 height=512 frameborder=0 src="//www.bing.com/maps/embed/?lvl=15&amp;cp=51.406943999999996~-0.027690999999996357&amp;sty=r&amp;draggable=false&amp;v=2&amp;dir=0&amp;form=LMLTEW&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;emid=46a36025-d70e-6fa3-bfb9-620440adccda&amp;w=640&amp;h=512"></iframe><div id=LME_maplinks style="line-height:20px;"><a id=LME_largerMap href="//www.bing.com/maps/?cp=51.406943999999996~-0.027690999999996357&amp;sty=r&amp;lvl=15&amp;where1=&amp;mm_embed=map&amp;form=LMLTEW" target=_blank>View Larger Map</a>&nbsp;<a id=LME_directions href="//www.bing.com/maps/?cp=51.406943999999996~-0.027690999999996357&amp;sty=r&amp;lvl=15&amp;rtp=~pos.51.406943999999996_-0.027690999999996357_&amp;mm_embed=dir&amp;form=LMLTEW" target=_blank>Get Directions</a>&nbsp;<a id=LME_birdsEye href="//www.bing.com/maps/?cp=sk117dgzxxpv&amp;sty=b&amp;lvl=18&amp;where1=&amp;mm_embed=be&amp;form=LMLTEW" target=_blank>View Bird's Eye</a></div> </div> </article> </li> <li> <article> <div class=title> <time>January 31st, 2012</time> <h2><a href="/family/2012-01-31-andy-goes-to-london/">Andy goes to London</a></h2> </div> <p>I spent 5 days in London, however, my luggage spent 3 days in London.</p> <p>We spoke at the DGI conference in London talking about our ultra-large scale concept for data. Because I spent so much time in London while I worked for Ford I kind of remembered my way around. I stayed down by Parliament in Central London (At Ford I always stayed at Tower Bridge – that was the only hotel on per-diem!)</p> <p>Here is the blurb from the conference agenda.</p> <p><blockquote><p>All data-intensive endeavors share the same problem: Our assets, which include data, information, and knowledge, as well as analytics, tools, and applications, are fractured in physically and semantically disparate systems. In short, our data enterprise is broken. As a result, insight is obscured and operations are impeded by our inability to fully search, explore, enrich and exploit those assets. In order to understand the full picture, we must break the data barriers. In this presentation, Dr. Yoakum-Stover describes a practical, Ultra-Large Scale systems solution for unified data storage and processing - one that addresses both the scale and diversity of data and processing without imposing constraints on what data must be or how they should be used. She describes how the core innovation underlying the approach - the Artifact, Data, and Model Description Frameworks (AD&amp;M DFs), can accommodate all data, information, and knowledge regardless of modality, structure, and semantics without data loss or distortion, and in particular how geospatial and temporal information are handled. Her talk concludes with a discussion of an instance of the complete system, the Data and Processing Syndicate, built on cloud compute and storage technology (HDFS, Map Reduce, Accumulo) that her engineering team is currently building for the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.</p></blockquote></p> <p>A few pictures from my iPhone.
