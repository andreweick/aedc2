The parents are suing her friend who had borrowed it. The new American way, if anything happens bad, then sue. Don't you think this is the type of thing that could be worked out between two friends.

I have always been a nature nut (or as some say, a nut by nature) and I relish any chance to hop on over to Solitude. Now, yesterday at dawn, June 26th, I was kinda stressed out, NukeBall had to be delayed (for the last time) to July 24th, and needed a break. I had been working all night (all through the rain and ten gazillion power failures) and suddenly I noticed it was freakin’ red outside. It was dawn and I hadn’t noticed.</p></p><p><p>For a very arid desert-like area, you don’t get too much visibility as there’s always sand blowing about. But the rain had cleared the air, and the red and blue sky was amazing! Like I mentioned, I love going to Solitude. It’s a small mountain range about 6 miles from where I live (See map below). Officially, the place has no name.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p> <p>Source: <a href="//www.nukeation.net/2006/06/27/Rains+Nature+Bandages.aspx">Dax Pandhi's nAesthetic - Rains, nature, bandages</a></p> <p>Bonus bug shot from Dax…</p> <p><a href="//www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/DaxPandhisnAestheticRainsnaturebandages_12E76/bug1.png"><img alt="" src="//www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/DaxPandhisnAestheticRainsnaturebandages_12E76/bug.png"/></a></p> <p>tags: <a href="//technorati.com/tag/hometown">hometown</a>, <a href="//technorati.com/tag/Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, <a href="//technorati.com/tag/India">India</a></p> </article> </li> </ul> </section> <ul class=pagination> <li class=prev> <a class=ss-navigateleft href="/family/page/851/">Prev</a> </li> <li class=next> <a class="ss-navigateright right" href="/family/page/853/">Next</a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
