You don't leave it where someone could steal or lose it. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but McCarthy certainly doesn't have a case. You can't sue someone you asked to watch your personal belongings. It's not their responsibility. I know of a freshman who left her Creative Zen on a school bus after a soccer game, but she didn't go and take the bus driver or bus company to court. It's not their fault she forgot about it! I just don't understand why people can't take responsibility for their own actions. Own your mistakes people, otherwise you're going to go through life blaming everyone for being unhappy. </p></p><p><p>Shannon goes on to say: "I put my trust in her and I thought she'd take care of it. She should have held on to it till third period or waited and given it to me after class." NO…you should have remembered to go back to class to retrieve your nano, not blame your friend for not holding onto it for you. </p></p><p><p>Why are kids bringing their iPods to school anyway? Leave them at home where they are safe. </p></p><p><p></p></blockquote> </p> <p>Source: <a href="//gearlog.com/blogs/gearlog/archive/2006/08/25/19728.aspx">Gearlog : Classmate Blamed for Missing iPod nano</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>tags: <a href="//technorati.com/tag/iPod">iPod</a>, <a href="//technorati.com/tag/lawsuit">lawsuit</a></p> </article> </li> <li> <article> <div class=title> <time>September 10th, 2006</time> <h2><a href="/family/2006-09-10-another-day-another-blogger-weighs-in-on-the-ipod-dispute/">Another day, another blogger weighs in on the iPod dispute...</a></h2> </div> <p> I found this in the comments section that I thought was interesting…</p> <p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Apparently there are two young teenagers, each acting their age, i.e. irresponsibly, and based on what little factual knowledge I have of the events at least one set of parents I would not wish as a role model for my own kids.</p></p><p><p>Assuming BH is who he or she claims, if you had invoked legal counsel and assuming counsel had encouraged you to file suit in the first place, the very first thing you would have been told is to and not make public statements about ongoing litigation unless such statements are prepared for or vetted by counsel.</p></p><p><p>I am not lawyer and haven’t even played one on T.V. - I did play myself on T.V. once, but that’s another story. Having said, in a lawsuit there are issues of fact and issues of law to decide; while I have no clue about a small claims court, in a civil trial issues of fact are otherwise decided by a jury and issues of law by a judge. I can’t speak to either of these, but there is a third component - when filing suit, you have to ask for a specific relief.</p></p><p><p>By refusing to accept the gift of a new iPod and iTunes certificate (and I’m not convinced that you can’t get these titles back at the cost of contacting Apple’s customer support in the worst case), you seem to have waived any entitlement to monetary relief.
