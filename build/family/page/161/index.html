The seminar was well attended and the discussions were thought provoking. Being around research scientists reminded me of growing up. While we were there they gave us a tour of the facilities, from the High Flux Isotope Reactor to the preserved <a href="//www.ornl.gov/info/news/cco/graphite.shtml">Graphite Reactor</a>.</p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-02-11/2012-02-07-at-14.54.25_Snapseed.jpg' title=ORNL /><figcaption>ORNL</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Worlds biggest computer. They told me how many terra-flops per-second by I forgot. I told Jasmine that I saw the worlds biggest computer, and she was very excited to see the pictures. She was disappointed because she thought it would look like a giant MacBook Pro.</p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-02-11/2012-02-07-at-15.33.20.jpg' title=original /><figcaption>original</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Because of my credentials, they were able to take us in the back door of the graphite reactor. A dusty and decaying building that they were struggling to preserve. This was one of the computers in the original control room â€“ I would imagine that my iPhone is more powerful then the computer that controled our first nuclear reactor.</p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-02-11/2012-02-07-at-15.34.54.jpg' title=original /><figcaption>original</figcaption></figure></p> <p><figure><img src='//media.eick.us/images/original/2012/2012-02-11/2012-02-07-at-15.37.08.jpg' title=original /><figcaption>original</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The graphite reactor loading face.

Andrew Eick, Institute for Modern Intelligence and Mission Focus Inc., Alexandria, Va.<br/>Computational Sciences and Engineering Division Seminar</p></p><p><p><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>A Data-space system seeks to develop a means to ingest structured and unstructured data of any format into a unified data store. Current, modern approaches to data base management limits modification of the data model or use of the data outside of its model.</p></p><p><p>Ultra-Large Scale (ULS) Data-space infrastructure is a technology stack with universal storage layers for: 1) unstructured data; 2) structured data; and 3) data/knowledge models. A fourth layer represents the means by which one can look into this Unified Data-space according to a chosen perspective or view to the data. The concept key to overcoming repetitive data integration is to unify the data without integrating it.</p></p><p><p>The solution developed to meet the minimal set of universal artifacts to describe structured data that could be used to display or capture data from any model is called the Data Description Framework (DDF). DDF is an abstraction over models that take data and semantics ingested from any number of silos and implements these within the storage model of choice. DDF seeks to minimize transformation of data, and instead, decouples data from models and models from storage schema. DDF avoids integrating or harmonizing data models up front. The native data and semantics become one unified framework; complete and undistorted. Upon this a whole new species of applications can be built using unified data without ever having to engage in the onerous task of data model harmonization.</p><footer>- [http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/calendar/calendar_full.cfm?Id=5104] [Computational Sciences and Engineering Division Seminar]</footer></blockquote></p> </article> </li> <li> <article> <div class=title> <time>February 10th, 2012</time> <h2><a href="/family/2012-02-10-lion-king-in-3-acts/">Lion King in 3 acts</a></h2> </div> <script src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/gpbp4gog.js"></script> <p>Libby and Jasmine singing songs (kind of from the Lion King) the other night. </p> <p>The video was recorded and created on my iPhone.
