href="/family/2007-06-21-blur-regions-using-techsmith-snagit/">Blur regions using TechSmith SnagIt</a></h2> </div> <p>One of my most used programs is <a href="//www.techsmith.com/snagit.asp">TechSmith SnagIt</a>.  TechSmith makes great tools, we use <a href="//www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia Studio</a> to generate 'online demo videos' for our AJAX toolkit <a href="//www.sss-research.com/">SSS Research</a>.  (And TechSmith started in the town where I grew up, and (I think) my brother went to East Lansing High School with one of the TechSmith team.)  All reasons to love them, sure, but I was using SnagIt before I found out any of those degrees of separation!</p> <p> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>I use SnagIt daily.  Working with computers, I'm the defacto tech support for my friends and family.  I used to answer support requests with "On the Tools</td> <td> Options</td> <td>Mail Format tab, choose the 'Signatures'  button…"  Now, when I get asked a question,  I just email back a few screen captures highlighting what options need to be modified.  My friends are happy because the screen captures are easier to follow than the menu hierarchy, and I'm happy because screen captures are quicker to make – just grab a screen, and draw an arrow to the button.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> <p>I also use SnagIt as my PDF generator.  Adobe Acrobat is the closest thing to a virus I know, and I won't install it on my computer.  SnagIt, however, can "save as" PDF, and with the latest release, they can even be installed as a print driver.  So, if I need to create a PDF report for somebody, I "print to SnagIt, and then Save As PDF."</p> <p> </p> <p>SnagIt can also upload straight to Flickr, which is pretty handy for blog posting.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blurring the background of images is pretty easy to accomplish, but I've always wanted to 'blur the foreground' of my capture.  This would allow me to blur out names or such before I post to the blog.  (SnagIt doesn't implement the 'invert selection' (ctrl-shift-I) that I'm so used to with PhotoShop, it seems obvious to me, so I'm sure it is on the list to do).</p> <p> </p> <p>I finally found how to blur the selection.  It's not the most discoverable feature to find (I've been wanting to use this feature for months) I will say that it is already in there.  Seeing as I can't use SnagIt to make a screen capture, I'll have to write out what the options are.</p> <p> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Get your screen capture into the SnagIt Capture Preview, highlight the region you want to blur, and choose 'Effects</td> <td>Image Processing</td> <td>Average Blur."  Choose the "blur amount" and your done.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> <p>Checkout <a href="//www.techsmith.com/snagit.asp">SnagIt</a>, <a href="//www.techsmith.com/snagit/newsandreviews.asp">read the reviews</a>, if you dismissed this as YASC (Yet Another Screen Capture) program, look again, it's a surprisingly useful product.  You will find yourself using more often than you thought.</p> <div class=wlWriterSmartContent>Technorati tags:

src="//media.eick.us/2011/05/539470453_f88f3934e2_o.png"/> The next thing that strikes me about Silverlight is that it will rely on an already massive developer resource in the Microsoft machine, MSDN, all the existing infrastructure and tools like MSSQL, and the deep experience in content streaming with Windows Media. </p></p><p><p>To put it simply, the Silverlight juggernaut is just another display layer or front-end enhancement to an already massive developer toolset that is enabling a throng of existing developers worldwide to create Flash-like interfaces without having to learn the often quirky Flash-only language. </p></p><p><p>The final nail in the proverbial coffin for me is definitely tool sets. </p></p><p><p></p></blockquote> </p> <p>I saw <a href="//www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Flash-in-the-Pan/0,130061733,339278335,00.htm">this article</a> the other day, and I totally agree with his argument.  If think VisualStudio is one of the best computer <strong>programs</strong> not just one of the best programming IDE's.  Everything seems to 'just work' in VS2005 the way you expect (at worst, it's a 'right click' away).  And when you need an advanced feature, it's already there (like custom data visualization in the debugger, intellisense for almost everything, and the code snippets, 'natch).  Compare VisualStudio 2005 to Photoshop CS2 in terms of usability – it took me years to learn the Photoshop options, and it still takes me quite some time to do mildly complex photo manipulations.</p> <p> </p> <p>As a developer, I had always wanted Flash to succeed.  They have <a href="//www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">98% browser penetration</a>, and the Internet is such a good distribution model.  What developer wouldn't want his application to run "out of the box, no install" on 98% of the computers?  I tried several times to convert my application over to ActionScript, but the tools were just not mature for real applications (No debugger to speak of, 'almost' XML support, no native SOAP/WS support).  The lack of features and tools just precluded any real applications.</p> <p> </p> <p>Wether Silverlight will kill flash or not is irrelevant to me.  Silverlight 1.1 alpha is showing lots of promise for me (it is <strong>so</strong> fast!), the key is to get it get widespread distribution.  It's a chicken and egg problem.  Until (any technology) has wide distribution, it's not worth writing software for it.  Once the technology has wide distribution, it's to late to start development.  Most of the environments I work in are totally locked down 'corporate' computers, so anything that is "already installed" is a pretty compelling environment to develop for.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="//www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Flash-in-the-Pan/0,130061733,339278335,00.htm">Flash in the Pan: News - Software - ZDNet Australia</a> </p> <p> </p> <div
