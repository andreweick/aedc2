A trip to California to let Judge Judith Sheindlin rule on the case of a missing iPod no longer appears to be in the cards for two local high-schoolers. While a spokesman for the "Judge Judy" show would not offer any official comment Thursday, on the Web site AndyEick.com, hosted by the uncle of 14-year-old Stephanie Eick, her father, Stephen, announced that the Eick family had declined to appear on the nationally syndicated show.

I want to confirm that we have been in discussions with the Judge Judy Reality TV show and decided to pass. Both Susan and I have been dismissed from the lawsuit and now Ms. McCarthy through her daughter is suing my 14-year old. Since Stephanie is being sued, a change of venue is her choice. She thought about the Judge Judy TV show, realized that she would miss two days of school and diving practice (She is on the high school diving team), and told me to pass. Both Susan and I support Stephanieâs decision. We had (and still have) the opportunity to do the Judge Mathis TV show which is filmed locally in Chicago. We both work and donât see the logic in traveling to California to settle a dispute that could be resolved locally in a couple hours. I am very proud of Stephanie. My daughterâs version of events is quite different from Ms. McCarthyâs and has now been corroborated by several other kids who witnessed the incident. Stephanie has received tremendous support from the other students at <a href="//wvhs.ipsd.org/">Waubonsie</a> high school. Several students have come to tell her that they support her and will be her friend.     Technorati tags: <a href="//technorati.com/tags/iPod">iPod</a>, <a href="//technorati.com/tags/lawsuit">lawsuit</a></p> </article> </li> </ul> </section> <ul class=pagination> <li class=prev> <a class=ss-navigateleft href="/family/page/830/">Prev</a> </li> <li class=next> <a class="ss-navigateright right" href="/family/page/832/">Next</a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
