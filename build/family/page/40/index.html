His name in Italy was Gusippe. His Mom's name was Maria Immaculata, his sister's name was Maria, his brothers name was Pasquale, his other brother's name was Domenico, and his Dad's name was Ferdanado Bruno. He lived on a farm that made olive oil. His dad made money by working in America to buy the farm. His dad became an American citizen when he worked in America. Joe liked to milk the goats and drink the warm milk. But he didn't stay on the farm long. He was sent away to boarding school when he was eleven because they didn't have school passed the 4th grade in his town. His dad got sick and died when Joe was eight, but his mom ket running the farm.</p> <p>While at boarding school, World War II started. His brother Domenico left the seminary to fight in the war and was killed on the Russian front. Joe's leg was injured when a bomb exploded near his school. So his mom made him come home because the school closed for the war. When school opened again, Joe graduated. His mom encouraged him to go to Baltimore Maryland and live with his uncle Bruno Reitanu. Since Joe's dad was American, Joe was also American so it was easy for him to immigrate.</p> <h1 id=chapter-2>Chapter 2</h1> <h2 id=middle-life>Middle Life</h2> <p>Joe moved to Baltimore Maryland when he was 18 years old. His uncle Bruno owned a store and a dance club in Dundak Maryland. Joe worked for his Uncle Burno, Aunt and three girl cousins. His favorite thing to do was go to the bay and eat crab.</p> <p>Two years later he visited his Uncle Louie and Aunt Rose in Detroit, Michigan. When Uncle Louie got joe a job at Chrysler, he decided to stay in Michigan. Joe met his wife Lena Sainato in winter of 1949. Joe knew Lena from school in Italy, but they never really talked much. They decided to get married on September 16, 1950. They moved in to the flat upstairs from Lena's parents. Chrysler kept laying Joe off from work. Lena's dad suggested he get a job with the city of Dearborn instead. He got a job as a garbage an and worked second shift at a deli. The mayor of Dearborn liked him so much that he gave him extra work to help build camp Dearborn. Joe was quickly promoted tat his job and eventually ran the whole sanitation department. In 1951 his daughter Mary was born, then in 1953 his son Fred was born. By 1955 he was able to buy a house that he lived in for 33 years. In late 1960's Joe opened his own barbershop Gene's barbershop – he bought it from Gene. He worked afternoon's at Gene's and all day Saturday. He would even cut hair in the basement after supper to earn extra money. Joe had two more kids Jim in 1966 and Denise in 1969. At this time, he started to buy rental houses to make money.</p> <h1 id=chapter-3>Chapter 3</h1> <h2 id=later-life>Later Life</h2> <p>In the 1970's, Joe was busy running parts of Dearborn, buying real estate, raising his family, and running Gene's barbershop. At this time Dearborn was getting a lot of Lebanese families escaping the war. He helped these people open new businesses and get settled into their new cit. He also started to buy a lot of houseses, apartment buildings and stores to rent out. He decided he liked to work with real estate and he continued work on a new strip mall that continues to be built even after his death. He retired from Dearborn, he volunteered at his Church and became the manager for the church. He helped renovate the church – all for free. Joe got cancer in 1998. He lived through lots of treatments and medicines until his death came on March 19, 2012. He died on the feast day of St. Joseph – an important day for Catholics.</p> <h1 id=contributions>Contributions</h1> <ul> <li>Helped many family members emigrated to America</li> <li>Faithful civil servant for the city of Dearborn</li> <li>Helped Dearborn rebuild Warren Ave with new Middle Eastern businesses</li> <li>Redeveloped lots of old and worn out sections of Dearborn.</li> <li>Helped fund the Italian American Fraternal Club</li> <li>Was awarded the key to the city for helping Dearborn so much</li> <li>Family man who helped get his children and grandchildren jobs to pay for college.</li> <li>helped build Camp Dearborn a fun recreational camp ground in Milford, MI</li> <li>Helped renovated St Clement Catholic Church</li> </ul> </article> </li> </ul> </section> <ul class=pagination> <li class=prev> <a class=ss-navigateleft href="/family/page/39/">Prev</a> </li> <li class=next> <a class="ss-navigateright right" href="/family/page/41/">Next</a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
