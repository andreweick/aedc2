M. Keithley and Mrs. Maggie French of Des Moines, these ladies being sister and sister in law of Mrs. Sackett and guests at the wedding of half century ago.</p> <p>The room were adorned with immense yellow and white chrysanthemums, and festoons of green.  Comrades of Pitzer Post G. A. R. and the sisters of Pitzer W.R.C. assembled to attend the reception from three to four o'clock.  An original poem commemorating the event was presented by Blair Wolf, after which, on behalf of Pitzer Corps, the president, Mrs. Zeller, gave Mrs. Sackett a beautiful silk flag in appreciation of her long and valued membership in the corps.  her services as an army nurse was mentioned by Mrs. Zeller in connection with Mr. Sackett's service in the civil war.  The comrades, through Commander Cooper, gave Mr. Sackett a money gift.</p> <p>The guests, after signing the guest book, were seated for refreshments.  The dining room was decorated in tiny yellow chrysanthemums.  A huge wedding cake, artistically ornamented with flowers formed of yellow fondant occupied the place of honor.  The cake was made by Mrs. Frank Sackett, the flowers being the skilful handiwork of Mrs. Keithley.  Ice cream wafers and coffee were served by Mmes. Lewis and Pratt.</p> <p>The children presented their father with a handsome gold headed cane, appropriately engraved, while to their mother, they gave a valuable gold handled umbrella.</p> <p>The Woman's club, of which Mrs. Sackett has long been a very active member, called later in the day with a gift of two five dollar gold pieces, a gold brooch, and a reading glass.  Other friends came to offer kind wishes and felicitations upon the unusual occasion.</p> <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sackett lived on a farm in Adair county from 1870-1896, when they came to Winterset to reside permanently.  Their long association with the First Presbyterian church here, with Pitzer Post and Corps, and their well known activity in all affairs worth while have endeared Mr. and Mrs. Sackett to a legion of sincere friends.  Mr. Sackett, at the age of 82 years, is a familiar figure on our streets.  Mrs. Sackett is a remarkable women, and at 76 years, is a marvel to many of a younger generation.  She has received state honors from W.R.C. serving two years as chaplain for department of Iowa.  her record as an army nurse is a source of pride to herself and her friends.</p> <p>This happy anniversary not only brought joy to the Sackett family, but to this community as well.</p> <p><div data-picture='' data-alt='Sackett Golden 1917'><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/480/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 320px)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/768/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 480px)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/900/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 768px)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/640/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/960/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 320px) and (-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 320px) and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/1536/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 480px) and (-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 480px) and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2)'></div><div data-src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/1800/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' data-media='(min-width: 768px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 768px) and (-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),(min-width: 768px) and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2)'></div><noscript><img src='//media.eick.us/images/generated/2010/2010-05-07/640/sackett-family-golden-1917-newspaper.jpg' alt='Sackett Golden 1917'></noscript></div><span id=photo-caption>Sackett Golden 1917</span><span id=photo-copyright>2010</span></p> </article> <ul class='pagination post-pagination'> <li class=prev> <a href="/family/2007-06-05-we8217ll-burn-those-bridges-when-we-get-there8230/"><div class='pagination-direction ss-navigateleft'>Previous</div> <p>Weâll burn those bridges when we get thereâ¦</p> </a> </li> <li class=next> <a href="/family/2007-06-08-3161920/"><div class='pagination-direction ss-navigateright right'>Next</div> <p>Quote</p> </a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
