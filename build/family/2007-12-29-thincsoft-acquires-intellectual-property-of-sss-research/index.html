A recent report released by Business Week indicated that over 80% of data maintained by corporations has a location component. Another survey—by Geospatial Solutions—showed that nearly 90% of respondents indicated a growing demand for location-based data across their organization. This growth is driven primarily by the value delivered in location-intelligence solutions across industries. These benefits include: reduced capital and operating expenses by tracking pumps and diagnostic equipment in hospitals and providing greater visualization into asset location; Improved sales and reduced unsold inventory in retailers by better clustering stores and inventory based on analysis of customer and demographic trends; Improved response time and reduced risk of casualties of first responders through greater visualization of all team member locations within a target area; and many more.</p> <p>thincSoft’s suite of Visual Intelligence (VI)TM software is available as a fully-configurable Web 2.0 solution for corporations and as an OEM solution for software vendors and systems integrators looking to enhance current BI, geospatial, or RFID/Asset Tracking solutions with a location visualization and analysis component.</p> <p>For more information, please visit <a href="//www.thincsoft.com">www.thincsoft.com</a>.</p> <p>About SSS Research</p> <p>SSS Research has served the Federal IT marketplace since 2003 across the Department of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, and other agencies.
