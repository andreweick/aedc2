As a very successful retailer, they have done a fantastic job of growing while maintaining customer intimacy and a strong brand image,” said thincSoft Chief Operating Officer Jim Kowalski. “As retailers continue to mine more and more data to better understand and serve their customers, they are seeking ways to utilize the more than 80% of corporate data that has a location component. We help them visualize this data in ways never before possible and help them make better decisions, faster.”</p> <p>“ABC Stores has continued to grow and be successful because we focus on our customers’ needs,” said Glenn Nishida, Chief Technology Officer. “As part of that focus, we seek to work with technology partners that deliver strong retail solutions which can be deployed quickly and easily integrated into our existing IT environment.”</p> <p>The thincVIew product will be integrated with ABC’s existing Oracle infrastructure and leverage key Oracle technologies to deliver map-based Business Intelligence to ABC decision makers through their planned corporate portal and dashboard.</p> <p>Most market studies indicate a growing demand among retailers for more tools that enable location-based analysis in an easy-to-use format. From viewing segments of customer loyalty or demographic data on easy-to-use maps to managing product performance at a shelf level using existing planograms and other planning tools, retailers are seeing the value of harnessing location-based data to make better decisions across a host of business disciplines. This type of analysis enables better store clustering, improved site selection, greater product visibility, even improved vendor performance and communication. Until recently, the only options available to retailers were tied to location content providers and other specialty vendors. thincSoft’s thincVIew product is the first to address the market for companies with heterogeneous data environments and those that wish to harness location data from multiple sources simultaneously. This technology ends the dependence on content and data providers for analysis tools and enables retailers to leverage their existing data and infrastructure to make better decisions while maintaining control and security of their data.</p> <p><strong>About thincSoft</strong></p> <p><a href="/admin/Pages/www.thincsoft.com">thincSoft</a> is the company that put Business Intelligence and asset tracking on the MapTM.  Their unique product suite combines the best of geospatial visualization with business intelligence and analysis.
