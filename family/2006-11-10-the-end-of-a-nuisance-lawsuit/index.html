As I mentioned in my first post, any dispute between two 13-year olds is a she-said she-said and the appropriate thing to do is split it. Actually, now that I know the full details, my daughter did nothing wrong. This is pretty much what Judge French said in the settlement conference. What the press has ignored as was pointed out by Judge French is that both kids are victims. The real culprit and thief is the third kid who actually took the iPod. As Judge French said, to win her case, Ms. McCarthy would need to prove that Stephanie acted negligently when judged by criteria appropriate for a 13-year old. Shannon accepted Stephanieâs 30GB iPod video, a significantly more powerful (and expensive) iPod than the 2GB iPod Nano that was lost. Both Shannon and Stephanie seemed quite pleased with the exchange. Stephanie has her eye on the new iPod widescreen video that is expected to be released shortly. Shannon now has 30GB of storage and verified with Apple that none of her iTunes has actually been lost, a fact that was pointed out early on in this dispute. The only person who appeared unsatisfied is Ms McCarthy. Ms McCarthy complained to the Judge that she didnât have time for a trial (which would take 15 minutes, but did have time to travel to California to do an appearance on the Judge Judy TV Show), could not understand a standard legal release, and that Stephanieâs used 30GB iPod Video was not comparable to daughterâs used 2GB iPod Nano. Judge French simply told her that the choice to accept the settlement, which is essentially what I offered in my one and only conversation with her back in August, was hers. Why instigate a litigation if you donât want to do a trial, do not want to deal with lawyers, and donât want to read legalese? My take? Too many people watch the court TV shows and think winning litigation is easy. Itâs not. As the judge said, compromise is hard. Filing this frivolous lawsuit wasted a bunch of time and we ended up right back were we started on day one. One positive aspect, I did have fun with the media. Itâs not every day that a silly dispute of a lost iPod in sleepy Naperville turns into an international media event. </p> <ul class=tags> <li><a href="/family/2006/">2006</a></li> <li><a href="/family/tags/work/">work</a></li> </ul> </article> <ul class='pagination post-pagination'> <li class=prev> <a href="/family/2006-11-09-jumping-on-the-sofa/"><div class='pagination-direction ss-navigateleft'>Previous</div> <p>Jumping on the sofa</p> </a> </li> <li class=next> <a href="/family/2006-11-12-office-2007-professional/"><div class='pagination-direction ss-navigateright right'>Next</div> <p>Office 2007 Professional</p> </a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
