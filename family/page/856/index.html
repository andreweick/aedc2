How would either Shannon, who was in the bathroom or her mother who wasn’t there, know what happened?  They claim that my daughter is responsible and have sued her for $350 for an iPod Nano, iTunes, and case – wow this seems pretty expensive, particularly since the iTunes are still on their computer.</p> <font size=3 color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"> </font> <p><strong>Did we have any warning that a suite coming?  No!</strong> Ms. McCarthy did call us once back in June.  She spoke with Susan Eick, Stephanie’s mom.  The call was sort of awkward since Ms. McCarthy lectured Susan about parental responsibility.  At this point we didn’t know anything about a lost iPod and needed to investigate.  There were no other calls, emails, or messages to either me or Susan before we were served with a court Summons.  The night we got served I called Ms. McCarthy and offered to split the cost of a new iPod.  She declined and said that she would see me in court.</p> <font size=3 color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"> </font> <p>I should point out that Still Middle School rules strictly prohibit the use of iPods at school.</p> <font size=3 color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"> </font> <p>We’ve become suit happy when we look around for someone to sue when an unfortunate incident happens.  I feel that it’s unfair of Shannon to blame Stephanie when left the iPod unattended.  It would have been better if Stephanie handed the iPod to Shannon rather than putting it in her purse on her desk.  Stephanie did not take it.  I would agree with shared culpability which is why I offered to split the cost.</p> <p> </p> </article> </li> </ul> </section> <ul class=pagination> <li class=prev> <a class=ss-navigateleft href="/family/page/855/">Prev</a> </li> <li class=next> <a class="ss-navigateright right" href="/family/page/857/">Next</a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Andy Eick</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="//missionfocus.com">My Company</a></li> <li><a href="//imintel.org">My Institute</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Blogs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/family">Family</a></li> <li><a href="/snapshot">Snapshot</a></li> <li><a href="/history">History</a></li> </ul> </nav> <nav> <h3 class=section-title>Pages</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="/bookshelf/index.html">Bookshelf</a></li> <li><a href="//soccer-peeps.com">Jasmine's Soccer</a></li> <li><a href="//eick-home.us.quickconnect.to/photo">Photo Archive</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=copyright> <p>&copy; 1999-2014</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
