It had neither studied them, nor developed doctrine and tactics to deal with them. It is fair to say that in 2003, most Army officers knew more about the U.S. Civil War than they did about counterinsurgency.<br /><br />The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual was written to fill that void. The result of unprecedented collaboration among top U.S. military experts, scholars, and practitioners in the field, the manual espouses an approach to combat that emphasizes constant adaptation and learning, the importance of decentralized decision-making, the need to understand local politics and customs, and the key role of intelligence in winning the support of the population. The manual also emphasizes the paradoxical and often counterintuitive nature of counterinsurgency operations: sometimes the more you protect your forces, the less secure you are; sometimes the more force you use, the less effective it is; sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction. <br /><br />An new introduction by Sarah Sewall, director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, places the manual in critical and historical perspective, explaining the significance and potential impact of this revolutionary challenge to conventional U.S. military doctrine.<br /><br />An attempt by our military to redefine itself in the aftermath of 9/11 and the new world of international terrorism, The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual will play a vital role in American military campaigns for years to come.<br /> <br />The University of Chicago Press will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to the Fisher House Foundation, a private-public partnership that supports the families of America’s injured servicemen.

Happiness isn't a physical thing, like walls and doors. But it's closely related. Managers know that if they can eliminate all traces of happiness, the employees won't be so picky about their physical surroundings. Once you're hopelessly unhappy, you won't bother to complain if your boss rolls you up in a tight ball and crams you into a cardboard box.<br /><br />As soon as I noticed this disturbing threat to workplace happiness, I did some investigative work and discovered it wasn't confined to the issue of office design. Companies were making a direct frontal assault on employee happiness in every possible way! I knew there was only one thing that could stop the horror.<br /><br />It was time for another Dilbert book.<br /><br />It might sound corny, but I felt an obligation to society. People told me it was time for me to "give something back to the community." This scared me, until I realized that no one knows I furnished my house with street signs and park benches. So I interpreted the "give something back to the community" message as a plea for me to write this book and then charge the community to read it.<br /><br />In the first part of this book I will tell you how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers, managers, customers, andbest of allthose lazy stockholders. The second part of the book teaches you my top-secret methods for mining humor out of ordinary situations, thus making it easier to mock the people around you. The third part of the book is made entirely of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that's why.<br /><br />Office Prank #44: Sounds That Drive Co-workers Crazy<br /><br />You can produce sounds in the office that will drive your co-workers insane. That can be very entertaining. Every co-worker is different, so you might have to experiment to find the sounds that are most annoying to your cubicle neighbor.

Many photographers struggle to achieve a high-impactportfolio, feeling that they lack the creative spark to invigorate them andmove their work forward.<br /><br />Creative 52 is that spark–and your guide to a new and more creative portfolio in just one year! A remedy for that “average” portfolio, this collection of innovative projects will help portrait, wedding, and fashion photographers build a portfolio that draws the attention of editors and clients–leaving the competition behind. While other how-to books often use bland imagery simply to prove a technical point, and many fine art books are filled with beautiful imagery but contain minimal (if any) educational insights to help working photographers, this book blends both: inspiration and knowledge that you can use to create images that attract potential clients.<br /><br />Divided into three parts–concept, technique, and post-processing–author Lindsay Adler’s 52 challenges each contain a description of the project, potential inspiration and suggestions of other artists to check out, and her own unique solution to the challenge–all to push you beyond your comfort zone to explore new ideas and approaches to your work. Includes a year’s worth of weekly projects that motivate you to experiment with new concepts, techniques, and software tools like Adobe Photoshop to achieve more eye-catching imagesOffers the cure for “expected” imagery, showing how to produce memorable photographs that are distinct from the competition, enabling you to reach new clientsEmpowers you with the encouragement and expertise necessary to create spectacular images</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/386DF34B-0EA1-4DE4-85E8-AB131914E496-140.png" width="124" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Shooting in Sh*tty Light: The Top Ten Worst Photography Lighting Situations and How to Conquer Them</div><span class="creator">Lindsay Adler, Erik Valind</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321862694</span><span class="description">Sometimes photographers have to shoot in less than ideal lighting situations. Maybe the wedding is mid-day in the middle of a field, or perhaps the event is in a florescent-lit room. These scenarios can be particularly intimidating for beginning photographers who don't know how to handle the many undesirable lighting situations they may encounter.<br /><br />In Shooting in Sh*tty Light, professional photographers Lindsay Adler and Erik Valind cover the top ten worst lighting situations and provide a variety of solutions for each. They explain which solutions are most practical and why one option might be preferable over another, examining such problems as extremely low lighting when no flash is allowed, strong backlight, and the light on an overcast day.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Unlike other books that focus on natural light or lighting in general, this book addresses a very real need of beginning photographers, answering the question, “What do I do when the lighting is terrible?” Lindsay and Erik candidly show you the tools at your disposal, demonstrating the techniques essential to getting the job done with minimal fuss.<br />Shows how to deal with ten of the worst lighting situations, such as harsh midday light, extremely low light, and mixed light.Offers real-life examples and practical solutions for handling poor light, such as identifying natural reflectors, bouncing light off a wall, or utilizing flash gels. Features a fun, conversational style to help you conquer the fear of poor lighting and approach any lighting situation with confidence!</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D9828524-EC08-420D-86ED-E13C5C4F57D3-140.png" width="119" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading</div><span class="creator">Mortimer J.

But unlike earlier editions, this book is now organized entirely around concepts and use cases, providing greater depth and readability.<br /><br />C# 3.0 introduces the most significant enhancements yet to the programming language, and C# 3.0 in a Nutshell delves deep into the subject while assuming minimal prior knowledge of C#-making it accessible to anyone with a reasonable background in programming. In addition to the language, the book covers the .NET CLR and the core Framework assemblies, along with the unified querying syntax called Language Integrated Query (LINQ), which bridges the traditional divide between programs and their data sources.<br /><br />Free of clutter and long introductions, this book provides a map of C# 3.0 knowledge in a succinct and unified style: Opening chapters concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types and variables, and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives<br /><br />Later chapters cover the core .NET 3.5 Framework, including such topics as LINQ, XML, collections, I/O and networking, memory management, reflection, attributes, security, threading, application domains and native interoperability<br /><br />Designed as a handbook for daily use, C# 3.0 in a Nutshell is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus on an applied technology such as WPF, ASP.NET, or WCF.

It includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer is the only available book on the Semantic Web to include a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios.After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters include XML and related technologies that support semantic interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both monotonic and nonmonotonic, in the framework of the Semantic Web; selected application domains and how the Semantic Web would benefit them; the development of ontology-based systems; and current debates on key issues and predictions for the future.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/51EDC84F-62BF-4AB0-8B67-E79048DE4159-140.png" width="119" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Speedliter's Handbook: Learning to Craft Light with Canon Speedlites</div><span class="creator">Syl Arena</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">032171105X</span><span class="description">Getting your Canon Speedlite to produce the light you need can be a real challenge.

Known for his photography, his teaching, and his ability to connect with photographers, Zack has long had an “open door” approach to discussing his career–the ups and the downs–and in so doing has provided a straightforward and candid look inside the industry. By consistently showing great work and offering helpful advice, he has built a large, loyal readership that looks to him for guidance in navigating the currents of a difficult and dynamic industry. Now, Zack finds yet another way to cut through the noise and offer truly valuable information to those struggling to make their way through the twists and turns of an ever-changing landscape.<br /><br />In Photography Q&amp;A, Zack answers over 100 questions that he fielded directly from the public. These are questions that range across all aspects of the photo industry: gear, marketing, street photography, vision, pricing, branding, light, models, work/life balance, technical advice, and much more. From how to “put yourself out there” and start to get jobs, to how to get paid for those jobs when the client is slow to cut the check–and everything in between– Photography Q&amp;A answers many of the pressing questions that photographers are asking, but until now have not been addressed. The book also includes intermittent “Visual Intermission” sections–where Zack discusses  individual images that were milestones in his development as a photographer–as well as worksheets on topics such as pricing and costs that help photographers to “know their numbers.”<br /><br />With all this material, and with insightful, honest answers that come straight from Zack’s experience as a photographer who has seen it all (or at least a lot of it), Photography Q&amp;A is an essential resource for any photographer looking for the real answers to the real questions in the industry today.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1DA4A5BA-BE96-42ED-83AF-84038D2A1AC8-140.png" width="123" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Earth from Above</div><span class="creator">Yann Arthus-Bertrand</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0810934957</span><span class="description">Three years ago Yann Arthus-Bertrand's Earth From Above-the result of a five-year airborne odyssey across five continents-was published around the world to critical and popular acclaim.

With its simple commands, flags, and parameters, a well-formed command-line application is the quickest way to automate a backup, a build, or a deployment and simplify your life.<br /><br />As Ruby pro David Copeland explains, writing a command-line application that is self-documenting, robust, adaptable and forever useful is easier than you might think. Ruby is particularly suited to this task, since it combines high-level abstractions with "close to the metal" system interaction wrapped up in a concise, readable syntax. Moreover, Ruby has the support of a rich ecosystem of open-source tools and libraries.<br /><br />Ten insightful chapters each explain and demonstrate a command-line best practice. You'll see how to use these tools to elevate the lowliest automation script to a maintainable, polished application.<br /><br />You'll learn how to use free, open source parsers to create user-friendly command-line interfaces as well as command suites. You'll see how to use defaults to keep options simple for everyday users, while giving advanced users options for more complex tasks.<br /><br />There's no reason a command-line application should lack documentation, whether it's part of a help command or a man page; you'll find out when and how to use both. Your journey from command-line novice to pro ends with a look at valuable approaches to testing your apps, and includes some fun techniques for outside-the-box, colorful interfaces that will delight your users.<br /><br />With Ruby, the command line is not dead. Long live the command line.<br /><br />What You Need:<br /><br />All you'll need is Ruby, and the ability to install a few gems along the way. Examples written for Ruby 1.9.2, but 1.8.7 should work just as well.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/09FE48B6-5FAB-409D-AAFB-9349BDBC4837-140.png" width="116" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sharp Shooter</div><span class="creator">Martin Bailey</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin"></span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/4B58DF26-2650-4666-8319-C2E865219FFF-140.png" width="90" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach, Second Edition</div><span class="creator">Pierre Baldi, Søren Brunak</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">026202506X</span><span class="description">An unprecedented wealth of data is being generated by genome sequencing projects and other experimental efforts to determine the structure and function of biological molecules. The demands and opportunities for interpreting these data are expanding rapidly. Bioinformatics is the development and application of computer methods for management, analysis, interpretation, and prediction, as well as for the design of experiments. Machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks, hidden Markov models, and belief networks) are ideally suited for areas where there is a lot of data but little theory, which is the situation in molecular biology. The goal in machine learning is to extract useful information from a body of data by building good probabilistic models — and to automate the process as much as possible.<br /><br />In this book Pierre Baldi and Søren Brunak present the key machine learning approaches and apply them to the computational problems encountered in the analysis of biological data. The book is aimed both at biologists and biochemists who need to understand new data-driven algorithms and at those with a primary background in physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer science who need to know more about applications in molecular biology.<br /><br />This new second edition contains expanded coverage of probabilistic graphical models and of the applications of neural networks, as well as a new chapter on microarrays and gene expression.

Gone is the clash of blocs, but replaced by what?<br /><br />Thomas Barnett has the answers. A senior military analyst with the U.S. Naval War College, he has given a constant stream of briefings over the past few years, and particularly since 9/11, to the highest of high-level civilian and military policymakers-and now he gives it to you. The Pentagon's New Map is a cutting-edge approach to globalization that combines security, economic, political, and cultural factors to do no less than predict and explain the nature of war and peace in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Building on the works of Friedman, Huntington, and Fukuyama, and then taking a leap beyond, Barnett crystallizes recent American military history and strategy, sets the parameters for where our forces will likely be headed in the future, outlines the unique role that America can and will play in establishing international stability-and provides much-needed hope at a crucial yet uncertain time in world history.<br /><br />For anyone seeking to understand the Iraqs, Afghanistans, and Liberias of the present and future, the intimate new links between foreign policy and national security, and the operational realities of the world as it exists today, The Pentagon's New Map is a template, a Rosetta stone.

This book will get you way up to speed on the technology you'll know it so well, in fact, that you can pass the Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD) 1.4 exam. If that's what you want to do, that is. Maybe you don't care about the exam, but need to use Servlets &amp; JSPs in your next project. You're working on a deadline. You're over the legal limit for caffeine. You can't waste your time with a book that makes sense only AFTER you're an expert (or worse one that puts you to sleep).<br /><br />No problem. Head First Servlets and JSP's brain-friendly approach drives the knowledge straight into your head (without sharp instruments). You'll interact with servlets and JSPs in ways that help you learn quickly and deeply. It may not be The Da Vinci Code, but quickly see why so many reviewers call it "a page turner". Most importantly, this book will help you use what you learn. It won't get you through the exam only to have you forget everything the next day.<br /><br />Learn to write servlets and JSPs, what makes the Container tick (and what ticks it off), how to use the new JSP Expression Language (EL), what you should NOT write in a JSP, how to write deployment descriptors, secure applications, and even use some server-side design patterns. Can't talk about Struts at a cocktail party? That'll change. You won't just pass the exam, you will truly understand this stuff, and you'll be able to put it to work right away.<br /><br />This new exam is tough—much tougher than the previous version of the SCWCD. The authors of Head First Servlets and JSP know: they created it. (Not that it EVER occurred to them that if they made the exam really hard you'd have to buy a study guide to pass it.) The least they could do is give you a stimulating, fun way to pass the thing.

If you are seriously interested in understanding how you and your team can start down the path of improvement with XP, you must read this book.”<br /><br />—Francesco Cirillo, Chief Executive Officer, XPLabs S.R.L. “The first edition of this book told us what XP was—it changed the way many of us think about software development. This second edition takes it farther and gives us a lot more of the ‘why’ of XP, the motivations and the principles behind the practices. This is great stuff. Armed with the ‘what’ and the ‘why,’ we can now all set out to confidently work on the ‘how’: how to run our projects better, and how to get agile techniques adopted in our organizations.”<br /><br />—Dave Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmers LLC “This book is dynamite! It was revolutionary when it first appeared a few years ago, and this new edition is equally profound. For those who insist on cookbook checklists, there’s an excellent chapter on ‘primary practices,’ but I urge you to begin by truly contemplating the meaning of the opening sentence in the first chapter of Kent Beck’s book: ‘XP is about social change.’ You should do whatever it takes to ensure that every IT professional and every IT manager—all the way up to the CIO—has a copy of Extreme Programming Explained on his or her desk.”<br /><br />—Ed Yourdon, author and consultant “XP is a powerful set of concepts for simplifying the process of software design, development, and testing. It is about minimalism and incrementalism, which are especially useful principles when tackling complex problems that require a balance of creativity and discipline.”<br /><br />—Michael A. Cusumano, Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of The Business of Software “Extreme Programming Explained is the work of a talented and passionate craftsman. Kent Beck has brought together a compelling collection of ideas about programming and management that deserves your full attention. My only beef is that our profession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are labeled ‘extreme.’...”<br /><br />—Lou Mazzucchelli, Fellow, Cutter Business Technology Council “If your organization is ready for a change in the way it develops software, there’s the slow incremental approach, fixing things one by one, or the fast track, jumping feet first into Extreme Programming. Do not be frightened by the name, it is not that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes and common sense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that has accumulated over the years.”<br /><br />—Philippe Kruchten, UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia “Sometimes revolutionaries get left behind as the movement they started takes on a life of its own. In this book, Kent Beck shows that he remains ahead of the curve, leading XP to its next level. Incorporating five years of feedback, this book takes a fresh look at what it takes to develop better software in less time and for less money. There are no silver bullets here, just a set of practical principles that, when used wisely, can lead to dramatic improvements in software development productivity.”<br /><br />—Mary Poppendieck, author of Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit “Kent Beck has revised his classic book based on five more years of applying and teaching XP. He shows how the path to XP is both easy and hard: It can be started with fewer practices, and yet it challenges teams to go farther than ever.”<br /><br />—William Wake, independent consultant “With new insights, wisdom from experience, and clearer explanations of the art of Extreme Programming, this edition of Beck’s classic will help many realize the dream of outstanding software development.”<br /><br />—Joshua Kerievsky, author of Refactoring to Patterns and Founder, Industrial Logic, Inc. “XP has changed the way our industry thinks about software development. Its brilliant simplicity, focused execution, and insistence on fact-based planning over speculation have set a new standard for software delivery.”<br /><br />—David Trowbridge, Architect, Microsoft Corporation<br /><br />Accountability. Transparency. Responsibility. These are not words that are often applied to software development.<br /><br />In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development by integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily development process.<br /><br />The first edition of Extreme Programming Explained is a classic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving small-team development, such as having developers write automated tests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly. Much has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second edition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting a program of continuous improvement based on: Five core values consistent with excellence in software developmentEleven principles for putting those values into actionThirteen primary and eleven corollary practices to help you push development past its current business and technical limitations<br /><br />Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned with your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational organization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to challenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to substantially improve your software development.<br /><br />You will discover how to: Involve the whole team—XP styleIncrease technical collaboration through pair programming and continuous integrationReduce defects through developer testingAlign business and technical decisions through weekly and quarterly planningImprove teamwork by setting up an informative, shared workspace<br /><br />You will also find many other concrete ideas for improvement, all based on a philosophy that emphasizes simultaneously increasing the humanity and effectiveness of software development.<br /><br />Every team can improve.

While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells programmers to "be careful!"), the author believes that byproducts of fear include tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored.

In this rich and rewarding new novel by the beloved bestselling author of<br />Talk Before Sleep and The Pull of the Moon, a reunion between two sisters and their mother reveals how the secrets and complexities of the past have shaped the lives of the women in a family.<br /><br />Ginny Young is on a plane, en route to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen or spoken to for thirty-five years.   She thinks back to the summer of 1958, when she and her sister, Sharla, were young girls. At that time,a series of dramatic events—beginning with the arrival of a mysterious and sensual next-door neighbor—divided the family, separating the sisters from their mother.  Moving back and forth in time between the girl she once was and the woman she's become, Ginny at last confronts painful choices that occur in almost any woman's life, and learns surprising truths about the people she thought she knew best.<br /><br />Emotional honesty and a true understanding of people and relationships are combined in this moving and deeply satisfying new book by the novelist who<br />"writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, love and hope.

It's a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book's easy-to-follow examples and explanations will give you immediate confidence as you build your Ruby programming skills.<br /><br />The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author David A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out.<br /><br />Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby's built-in, core classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers, arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get attention, as do file and other I/O operations.<br /><br />Along the way, the reader is introduced to numerous tools included in the standard Ruby distribution—tools like the task manager Rake and the interactive Ruby console-based interpreter Irb—that facilitate Ruby development and make it an integrated and pleasant experience.<br /><br />The book encompasses advanced topics, like the design of Ruby's class and module system, and the use of Ruby threads, taking even the new Rubyist deep into the language and giving every reader the foundations necessary to use, explore, and enjoy this unusually popular and versatile language.<br /><br />It's no wonder one reader commented: "The technical depth is just right to not distract beginners, yet detailed enough for more advanced readers."<br /><br />Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning.

Why is this? XML is a meta language, meaning a language which describes data. Like HTML, it is a sub set of SGML (Standardized General Mark Up Language) but unlike HTML it is infinitely extensible. What do we mean by this? Well, HTML has a fixed number of tags and for the most part, these tags define what a page of text will look like in your browser - will it be bold, italic, a paragraph, a heading etc. This tells you nothing about the data the page contains. In XML, there is no limit to the number of tags and each tag describes the data it contains. So, if I was summarizing these book details in XML, I would have an pair of tags which would contain the ISBN number of the book, a pair of tags, an pair of tags and so on. So what, you may ask? So... the possibilities this opens up for identifying and sorting data are huge. If I had a whole pile of individual title information sheets, and I wanted to produce a single document that listed all the ISBNs, all the prices etc, I would just sort on the specific XML tags. If I turned a book into XML - the Bible, the Koran and the works of Shakespeare have already been done - and then wanted details of a specific subject I would search for the XML tagged data. XML is a user-friendly version of SGML that will make the management of huge sets of on-line documentation much easier. It's a language which describes data, making it much easier to find and sort by the data type you require. It opens up the opportunity for industry groups, like the health-care and automotive industries to create their own specific languages for the interchange of data. It speeds up the transfer of data from a database on the server to an application on the client - check out the Microsoft auction demo on the MS XML web page. It has immense potential, and, crucially the support of both the major browser companies.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/3633A444-E3BF-4716-AE4C-0B2D1C3C6809-140.png" width="114" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Rodale's All-New Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening: The Indispensable Resource for Every Gardener</div><span class="creator">Fern Marshall Bradley, Barbara W.

Angelika Langer, Independent Consultant and C++ Report Columnist<br /><br />"A superbly authored treatment of the STL......an excellent book which belongs in any serious C++ developer's library." Jim Armstrong, President 2112 F/X, Texas.<br /><br />The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) represents a breakthrough in C++ programming techniques. With it, software developers can achieve vast improvements in the reliability of their software, and increase their own productivity.<br /><br />Designing Components with the C++ STL has three aims:<br /><br />* to introduce the reader to the STL * to show how this powerful resource can be exploited * to extend its use to the construction of new components.<br /><br />This revised edition is fully compliant with the new ISO/IEC C++ Standard with an associated web site containing numerous, fully up-to-date examples for downloading.<br /><br />The author shows how to make practical use of the STL through a wealth of examples and by drawing on his extensive experience and knowledge gained working with the C++ Standardization Committee. Unique insight into the internals of the STL takes the reader beyond simply using it, to show how the components supplied in the STL can be used to design more complex data structures and algorithms, and powerful abstract data types. Throughout, the author maintains an elegant and sophisticated coding style, adhering faithfully to the current ISO/ANSI standards, helping to ensure that your software will be even more portable, maintainable and reusable than ever.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/58D4055F-1643-4B81-AECA-96135CB18B91-140.png" width="101" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation, Second Edition</div><span class="creator">Owen Briggs, Steven Champeon, Eric Costello, Matt Patterson</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">159059231X</span><span class="description">This book is a focused guide to using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the visual design of web pages. It provides concise coverage of all the essential CSS concepts developers need to learn (such as separating content from presentation, block and inline elements, inheritance and cascade, the box model, typography, etc). It also covers the syntax needed to effectively use CSS with your markup document (for example CSS rules, how to structure a style sheet, linking style sheets to your (X)HTML documents, CSS boxes etc).<br /><br />CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful technology that can be used to add style and structure to your web pages without needing to resort to "hacks" such as HTML table layouts and "spacer images". However, this is not the only advantage over other styling methods. You can specify your CSS styles in a separate file, then apply those styles to every page in your web site. When you want to change a style on your site, you can do it by modifying one style sheet, rather having to update every page. This is only one example of the many advantages CSS brings to your web development work.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5BED2955-DD4A-4B05-BAE7-997D7C84135B-140.png" width="111" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Da Vinci Code</div><span class="creator">Dan Brown</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0307474275</span><span class="description">PREMIUM MASS MARKET EDITION<br /><br /> <br /><br />#1 Worldwide Bestseller—More Than 80 Million Copies Sold<br /><br /> <br /><br />As millions of readers around the globe have already discovered, The Da Vinci Code is a reading experience unlike any other.

I resonated with one insight after another, having witnessed too many wayward projects myself. The experience in this book is palpable." -John Vlissides, IBM Research "This book allows managers, architects, and developers to learn from the painful mistakes of others. The high-level AntiPatterns on software architecture are a particularly valuable contribution to software engineering. Highly recommended!" -Kyle Brown Author of The Design Patterns Smalltalk Companion "AntiPatterns continues the trend started in Design Patterns. The authors have discovered and named common problem situations resulting from poor management or architecture control, mistakes which most experienced practitioners will recognize. Should you find yourself with one of the AntiPatterns, they even provide some clues on how to get yourself out of the situation." -Gerard Meszaros, Chief Architect, Object Systems Group Are you headed into the software development mine field? Follow someone if you can, but if you're on your own-better get the map! AntiPatterns is the map. This book helps you navigate through today's dangerous software development projects. Just look at the statistics:<br />* Nearly one-third of all software projects are cancelled.<br />* Two-thirds of all software projects encounter cost overruns in excess of 200%.<br />* Over 800f all software projects are deemed failures.<br />While patterns help you to identify and implement procedures, designs, and codes that work, AntiPatterns do the exact opposite; they let you zero-in on the development detonators, architectural tripwires, and personality booby traps that can spell doom for your project. Written by an all-star team of object-oriented systems developers, AntiPatterns identifies 40 of the most common AntiPatterns in the areas of software development, architecture, and project management. The authors then show you how to detect and defuse AntiPatterns as well as supply refactored solutions for each AntiPattern presented.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B4EF68B9-23C3-4D96-B9EC-85E9D60614E3-140.png" width="115" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 1: A System of Patterns</div><span class="creator">Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal</span><span class="rating">4.5</span><span class="asin">0471958697</span><span class="description">Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/526589A7-AF79-46DF-ABD2-BFF44A9BE87E-140.png" width="116" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 4: A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing</div><span class="creator">Frank Buschmann, Kevlin Henney, Douglas C.

Christensen exposed this crushing paradox behind the failure of many industry leaders: by placing too much focus on pleasing their most profitable customers, these firms actually paved the way for their own demise by ignoring the disruptive technologies that aggressively evolved to displace them. In The Innovator’s Solution, Christensen and coauthor Michael E. Raynor help all companies understand how to become disruptors themselves.<br /><br />Clay Christensen (author of the award-winning Harvard Business Review article, How Will You Measure Your Life?”) and Raynor not only reveal that innovation is more predictable than most managers have come to believe, they also provide helpful advice on the business decisions crucial to truly disruptive growth. Citing in-depth research and theories tested in hundreds of companies across many industries, the authors identify the processes that create successful innovationand they show managers how to tailor their strategies to the changing circumstances of a dynamic world.<br /><br />The Innovator’s Solution is an important addition to any innovation library.<br /><br />Published by Harvard Business Review Press.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D24160E8-0C51-4C6B-80B1-CE1A1D6DD631-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Great Light, Easy Light</div><span class="creator">Kevin Clark</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin"></span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D9690086-B314-43BB-B205-6EB01D2A5B71-140.png" width="90" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Advanced Rails Recipes</div><span class="creator">Mike Clark</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">0978739221</span><span class="description">Ruby on Rails continues to build up a tremendous head of steam.

Now there's help. The long-awaited official documentation to Maven is here.<br /><br />Written by Maven creator Jason Van Zyl and his team at Sonatype, Maven: The Definitive Guide clearly explains how this tool can bring order to your software development projects. Maven is largely replacing Ant as the build tool of choice for large open source Java projects because, unlike Ant, Maven is also a project management tool that can run reports, generate a project website, and facilitate communication among members of a working team.<br /><br />To use Maven, everything you need to know is in this guide. The first part demonstrates the tool's capabilities through the development, from ideation to deployment, of several sample applications — a simple software development project, a simple web application, a multi-module project, and a multi-module enterprise project.<br /><br />The second part offers a complete reference guide that includes:<br /><br />The POM and Project RelationshipsThe Build LifecyclePluginsProject website generationAdvanced site generationReportingPropertiesBuild ProfilesThe Maven RepositoryTeam CollaborationWriting PluginsIDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, ands NetBeansUsing and creating assembliesDeveloping with Maven Archetypes<br /><br />Several sources for Maven have appeared online for some time, but nothing served as an introduction and comprehensive reference guide to this tool — until now. Maven: The Definitive Guide is the ideal book to help you manage development projects for software, web applications, and enterprise applications.

Linux is the fastest-growing segment of the Unix market, is winning over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas, and is being viewed more and more as a good platform for embedded systems. Linux Device Drivers, already a classic in its second edition, reveals information that heretofore has been shared by word of mouth or in cryptic source code comments, on how to write drivers for a wide range of devices.<br /><br />Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel includes significant changes to device drivers, simplifying many activities, but providing subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. The second edition of this book thoroughly covers these changes, as well as new processors and buses.<br /><br />You don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book; all you need is an understanding of C and some background in Unix system calls. You'll learn how to write drivers for character devices, block devices, and network interfaces, guided by full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware. Major changes in the second edition include discussions of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and locking, new CPUs, and recently supported buses. For those who are curious about how an operating system does its job, this book provides insights into address spaces, asynchronous events, and I/O.<br /><br />Portability is a major concern in the text. The book is centered on version 2.4, but includes information for kernels back to 2.0 where feasible. Linux Device Driver also shows how to maximize portability among hardware platforms; examples were tested on IA32 (PC) and IA64, PowerPC, SPARC and SPARC64, Alpha, ARM, and MIPS.<br /><br />Contents include: Building a driver and loading modulesComplete character, block, and network driversDebugging a driverTimingHandling symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systemsMemory management and DMAInterruptsPortability issuesPeripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/8A1DB6B9-44A5-48DE-A058-0AC2CF537173-140.png" width="108" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Century of Champions</div><span class="creator">Nicholas J.

The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood. What is the true role of a tester? Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?”<br /><br />Two of the industry’s most experienced agile testing practitioners and consultants, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, have teamed up to bring you the definitive answers to these questions and many others. In Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you how to use the agile testing quadrants to identify what testing is needed, who should do it, and what tools might help. The book chronicles an agile software development iteration from the viewpoint of a tester and explains the seven key success factors<br />of agile testing.<br /><br />Readers will come away from this book understanding<br />How to get testers engaged in agile developmentWhere testers and QA managers fit on an agile teamWhat to look for when hiring an agile testerHow to transition from a traditional cycle to agile developmentHow to complete testing activities in short iterationsHow to use tests to successfully guide developmentHow to overcome barriers to test automationThis book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/89ECF811-9E2F-4CAA-AA35-2E1CA93B7853-140.png" width="106" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse, 2nd Edition</div><span class="creator">Jim D'Anjou, Scott Fairbrother, Dan Kehn, John Kellerman, Pat McCarthy</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321305027</span><span class="description">“Fully updated and revised for Eclipse 3.0, this book is the definitive Eclipse reference—an indispensable guide for tool builders, rich client application developers, and anyone customizing or extending the Eclipse environment.”<br /><br />—Dave Thomson, Eclipse Project Program Director, IBM The Ultimate Guide to Eclipse 3.0 for the Java Developer.

But when it comes to web development, many frameworks seem over-engineered and too complex. They have a steep learning curve, and it's just too difficult to get them to do exactly what you need because of their "closed-box" design.<br /><br />Stripes brings simplicity back to Java web development. You'll be up and running in minutes, and can go a long way with just a few simple concepts. You'll spend your time developing your application, not maintaining gobs of configuration. Because Stripes is very transparent, you will understand exactly what is going on from request to response.<br /><br />The popularity of Stripes keeps increasing because of its clean design and extensibility. With this complete tutorial and reference, you can master Stripes and take advantage of its productivity in web application development. You'll tailor the framework to your requirements, not the other way around!<br /><br />This book is packed with explanations and examples so that you learn practical problem-solving techniques. You'll be able to "wrap your head around the framework" and fully understand how Stripes works. When a client requests a feature, you'll answer "yes" with confidence because you're using a framework that lets you get the results that you need without getting in your way. Because of its open design, Stripes lets you easily integrate your favorite tools: tag libraries, AJAX frameworks, ORM solutions, dependency injectors, and more.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/8D8A8A53-69F8-49D4-8456-BE1D658721D2-140.png" width="118" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Flash MX Magic</div><span class="creator">Matthew David, Mark Baltzegar, Veronique Brossier, Jim Caldwell, John Dalziel, Aria Danika, Robert M.

Get your bearings with Mark Denny—an expert at explaining scientific concepts in non-technical language—in this all-encompassing look at the history and science of navigation.<br /><br />Denny’s tour kicks off with key facts about the earth and how its physical properties affect travel. He discusses cartography and early mapmakers, revealing fascinating tidbits such as how changes over time of the direction of true north, as well as of magnetic north, impacted navigation. Denny details the evolution of navigation from the days of coastal piloting to GPS and other modern-day technologies.

Often even the most basic notions like "action" or "process" are not precisely defined. Next, in order to master the diversity and the complexity of contemporary enterprises, theories are needed that separate the stable essence of an enterprise from the variable way in which it is realized and implemented.<br /><br />Such a theory and a matching methodology, which has passed the test of practical experience, constitute the contents of this book. The enterprise ontology, as developed by Dietz, is the starting point for profoundly understanding the organization of an enterprise and subsequently for analyzing, (re)designing, and (re)engineering it. The approach covers numerous issues in an integrated way: business processes, in- and outsourcing, information systems, management control, staffing etc.<br /><br />Researchers and students in enterprise engineering or related fields will discover in this book a revolutionary new way of thinking about business and organization. In addition, it provides managers, business analysts, and enterprise information system designers for the first time with a solid and integrated insight into their daily work.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/0A5E3E5C-AE83-4A45-8D93-7D68B0762017-140.png" width="93" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">WebSphere Engineering: A Practical Guide for WebSphere Support Managers and Senior Consultants</div><span class="creator">Ying Ding</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">0137142250</span><span class="description">The Practical, End-to-End Guide to WebSphere®  Infrastructure Engineering and Technical Management<br /><br /> <br /><br />Companies depend on the IBM® WebSphere platform to deliver mission-critical Web applications and services and to provide the foundation for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

Rather than handcrafting each piece of code, developers are increasingly turning to code generation based on templates and applications of business logic to automatically perform a variety of tasks. This book teaches the technical details of code generation in .NET through a coherent series of steps that will help you to incorporate code generation into your own development efforts.<br /><br />Veteran author Kathleen Dollard teaches code generation as a scripted repeatable process using templates you control, so you're not tied to a particular framework or style. Because you can regenerate code at any time, you can incorporate changes, including database changes, throughout the life of your application. The templates are flexible and designed to work smoothly with the handcrafted code you'll use to customize your application. The underlying fundamentals are explained along with three specific techniques: outputting code to a stream, using the Code DOM, and using XSLT-based code generation.<br /><br />In addition to the text, the tools in the book (downloadable in both VB .NET and C#) include a mechanism to extract information from SQL Server; a tool for editing and running code-generation scripts; a simple, flexible ORM tool that relates your database structure to your runtime class model; and a set of templates you can use as the starting point for your adventures in code generation.<br /><br />Generating repetitive sections of code frees you to focus on the features that make your application unique. Code generation will turbo-charge your development cycles by offering speed, reusability, agility, and consistency.

Then, it’s on to an in-depth look at the lighting setups and looks that made Frank famous (complete with diagrams and detailed explanations).You’ll see how Frank lights his images (you’ll be shocked at how simple most of his lighting setups are and you’ll be able to create these same setups yourself), plus he covers the critical little stuff nobody else is talking about, including: how to calibrate your monitor (and why it’s so important); how to use a color target to nail your color every single time; and why (and how) to use a light meter to get consistent, reproducible lighting each and every shoot.<br /><br />Frank also shares his own retouching techniques through step-by-step tutorials, and he takes you from start to finish through a number of different looks so you can see exactly how it’s done, and recreate these same looks yourself. If you’ve ever wished there was one book that covers it all, the whole process of photographing models from start to finish, not leaving anything out, then this is the book for you.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/FCFF32DD-2966-4CF4-90CE-9F24814B9B1C-140.png" width="140" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Apple Pro Training Series: OS X Lion Server Essentials: Using and Supporting OS X Lion Server</div><span class="creator">Arek Dreyer, Ben Greisler</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321775082</span><span class="description">The only Apple-certified book on OS X Lion Server, this comprehensive reference takes support technicians and ardent Mac users deep inside this server operating system, covering everything from networking technologies to service administration, customizing users and groups, and more.

The key, as the authors show, is to integrate regularly and often using continuous integration (CI) practices and techniques.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The authors first examine the concept of CI and its practices from the ground up and then move on to explore other effective processes performed by CI systems, such as database integration, testing, inspection, deployment, and feedback. Through more than forty CI-related practices using application examples in different languages, readers learn that CI leads to more rapid software development, produces deployable software at every step in the development lifecycle, and reduces the time between defect introduction and detection, saving time and lowering costs. With successful implementation of CI, developers reduce risks and repetitive manual processes, and teams receive better project visibility.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The book covers How to make integration a “non-event” on your software development projectsHow to reduce the amount of repetitive processes you perform when building your softwarePractices and techniques for using CI effectively with your teamsReducing the risks of late defect discovery, low-quality software, lack of visibility, and lack of deployable softwareAssessments of different CI servers and related tools on the market<br /><br />The book’s companion Web site, www.integratebutton.com, provides updates and code examples.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/21147567-1214-4B8A-921B-B0D3C4802EC5-140.png" width="106" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Design of Sites: Patterns, Principles, and Processes for Crafting a Customer-Centered Web Experience</div><span class="creator">Douglas K. van Duyne, James A.

From the author of the bestselling Java in a Nutshell, this companion book picks up where Java in a Nutshell leaves off, providing a suite of example programs for novice Java programmers and experts alike. Java Examples in a Nutshell contains all of the example programs from the first edition of Java in a Nutshell, completely updated for Java 1.1, and expands on the examples from the second edition that demonstrate the new features in Java 1.1. It also provides never-before- published programming examples for remote method invocation, database connectivity, and security — important elements of the Java Enterprise APIs. Finally, the book offers a glimpse of the features of "Swing," the set of new components that are part of the forthcoming Java Foundation Classes (JFC).</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/E701B8D3-95EA-4F4D-9042-9E34ADDB391D-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Java in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference for Java Programmers (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly))</div><span class="creator">David Flanagan</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">156592262X</span><span class="description">The bestselling Java in a Nutshell has been updated to cover Java 1.1. If you're a Java programmer who is migrating to 1.1, this second edition contains everything you need to get up to speed on the new features of Java 1.1. Or if you are just now jumping on the Java bandwagon, Java in a Nutshell still has all of the features that have made it the Java book most often recommended on the Internet. An advanced introduction to Java for C and C++ programmers teaches you everything you need to know about the language, while the complete quick-reference contains descriptions of all of the classes in the Java 1.1 API, with the exception of the Enterprise APIs.<br />Java in a Nutshell also fully describes the syntax of the Java language, making it the only quick reference that a Java programmer needs.<br /><br />The second edition of Java in a Nutshell covers Version 1.1 of the Java Development Kit (JDK). It includes all of the material from the first edition, as well as the following updated information for Java 1.1: A detailed overview of all of the features in Java 1.1, both on a package-by-package basis and in terms of overall functionality.A comprehensive tutorial on "inner classes" that explains how to use all of the new types of inner classes: static member classes, member classes, local classes, and anonymous classes.Practical, real-world example programs that demonstrate the features in Java 1.1, including object serialization, the new AWT event handling model, internationalization, and a sample Java Bean.A complete quick reference for all of the classes, methods, and variables in the core Java 1.1 API. The quick-reference pages include indicators that make it easy to find the 1.1 material. In addition, cross-reference material is now provided directly on each reference page.<br /><br />With the 1.1 release, Java has grown too large to fit in a single book, even in quick-reference form. Thus, we see the need to split Java in a Nutshell into multiple volumes. This volume, the "original" Java in a Nutshell, documents the most commonly used features of Java and is an indispensable reference for all Java programmers. We may publish a separate volume that will cover the Java "Enterprise APIs", which include the database connectivity, remote method invocation, and security features, as well as other forthcoming components, such as CORBA IDL support and the electronic commerce framework. And as other new Java APIs are developed and released, we may consider adding new volumes to the Java in a Nutshell series.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/9B077568-9C2E-4702-B7AC-6DB697226E69-140.png" width="95" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Take Control of BBEdit</div><span class="creator">Glenn Fleishman</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B007IJW3RY</span><span class="description">Read this 199-page ebook to learn how to: Set up BBEdit for maximum efficiency: Configure key standard and expert preferences for optimal usage.Sync BBEdit settings and support files between Macs using Dropbox.Create text factories that automate sequences of text processing commands.Create "clippings" of boilerplate text, complete with dynamic placeholders.Use Dropbox or a version control system to track versions of documents.Start work on the right track: Collect multiple resources—including files, folders, and URLs—into a single project window.Use BBEdit's many options for opening and saving files.Work with remote files via BBEdit's FTP/SFTP browser windows.Type faster, search better, and automate repetitive bits: Control BBEdit with keyboard shortcuts.Write faster with text completion of words, code snippets, HTML tags, and more.Clean up text with spurious tabs, incorrect case, gremlin characters, and more.Search for and replace text across multiple documents at once.Learn how to use grep pattern matching for powerful searches.Write in Markdown, and preview Markdown documents.Compare and collaborate effectively: Discover best practices for commenting and revision tracking.Compare multiple versions of documents.Run your Web site like a wizard: Create HTML and CSS files using BBEdit's effective, extensive markup tools.Preview dynamic pages locally with user-defined preview templates.Clean up old or badly coded Web pages.Build Web sites using templates and includes.Connect BBEdit to Fetch, Interarchy, or Transmit to edit remote files.Maintain Web sites in BBEdit using four different workflows.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/954895D3-42AD-4177-976E-E01C4EA3155B-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel</div><span class="creator">Jonathan Safran Foer</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0547735022</span><span class="description">New York Times bestseller<br /><br />A Best Book of the Year<br />Los Angeles Times, Washington Post Book World, Chicago Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Rocky Mountain News<br /><br />“Energetic, inventive, and ambitious . . . an uplifting myth born of the sorrows of 9/11.” —Boston Globe<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer emerged as one of the most original writers of his generation with his best-selling debut novel, Everything Is Illuminated.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.<br /><br />With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.<br /><br />In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C69F0D78-56FD-4EEC-A1C3-B5BF65B54632-140.png" width="114" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language</div><span class="creator">Martin Fowler, Kendall Scott</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">020165783X</span><span class="description">Provides a guide designed for the professional programmer interested in improving the internal design of existing code.

Words and characters once impressed in clay, written on papyrus, and printed with ink are now manifest in pixels of light. Today's web typographers can help their readers find, understand, and connect with the words, ideas, and information they seek.<br />Thus, legibility and readability are the foundations for the typographic theories and practice covered in Typographic Web Design. You'll learn how to choose fonts, organize information, create a system of hierarchy, work with tabular information, create a grid, apply a typographic system across multiple pages, and build a font library.<br /><br />Each chapter provides time-tested typography rules to follow (modified for the web), explains why they work, when to break them, and offers the opportunity to test the rules with hands-on exercises in HTML and CSS. If you don't know HTML and CSS, Typographic Web Design provides a walk-through for each lesson, showing you how to plan and write syntax. Readers are sure to come away with an understanding of typographic principles, as well as the HTML and CSS skills needed to implement them on the web.<br /><br />Typographic Web Design<br />•Applies decades of typographic theory and practice (e.g., how to choose a font) directly to web design (e.g., how to use the @font-face property in CSS).<br />•Clearly explains all typographic rules presented, providing examples that contrast successful and less successful typographic solutions.<br />•Is written for visual thinkers.

It's one topic, in fact, that .NET forces you to address, since Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET Framework. Yet, because a developer's carelessness or lack of experience can still allow a program to be used in an unintended way, Programming .NET Security shows you how the various tools will help you write secure applications. The book works as both a comprehensive tutorial and reference to security issues for .NET application development, and contains numerous practical examples in both the C# and VB.NET languages. With Programming .NET Security, you will learn to apply sound security principles to your application designs, and to understand the concepts of identity, authentication and authorization and how they apply to .NET security.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/9E59C706-0DF2-42F9-9E24-0FC029CD2C32-140.png" width="107" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Head First Design Patterns</div><span class="creator">Elisabeth Freeman, Eric Freeman, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Elisabeth Robson</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0596007124</span><span class="description">You're not alone.<br /><br />At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns—the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.<br /><br />You want to learn about the patterns that matter—why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look "in the wild". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.<br /><br />You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern.<br /><br />Most importantly, you want to learn the "secret language" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.<br /><br />With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the "Trading Spaces" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.<br /><br />If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect—a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/233A3213-56CD-4E38-A13C-883F4EA5BF5B-140.png" width="121" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Michael Freeman's Perfect Exposure: The Professional's Guide to Capturing Perfect Digital Photographs</div><span class="creator">Michael Freeman</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0240811712</span><span class="description">Clear, direct and guaranteed, the perfect exposure method looks at the way professionals work, and lays out the decisions and sequences with absolute clarity, while incorporating the latest, powerful post-processing techniques. Chosing the exposure for a photograph is infinitely complex and one of photography's most absorbing paradoxes because it affects everything in the image and its effect on the viewer. Understanding how and why exposure works is essential, not only because it helps you to decide what is instinctively "right," but this book will give you confidence in that decision—an invaluable skill for every single photographer. Full of beautiful photographs taken by Michael Freeman, this book will arm you with the tools you need for perfect exposure of your photographs.<br /><br />Michael Freeman is the author of the global bestseller, The Photographer's Eye.  Now published in sixteen languages, The Photographer's Eye continues to speak to photographers everywhere.

The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling composition has always been one of the key skills in making photographs.<br /><br />Digital photography has brought a new, exciting aspect to design - first because the instant feedback from a digital camera allows immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because image-editing tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on the way digital photographers take pictures.<br /><br />Now published in sixteen languages, The Photographer's Eye continues to speak to photographers everywhere. Reaching 100,000 copies in print in the US alone, and 300,000+ worldwide, it shows how anyone can develop the ability to see and shoot great digital photographs. The book explores all the traditional approaches to composition and design, but crucially, it also addresses the new digital technique of shooting in the knowledge that a picture will later be edited, manipulated, or montaged to result in a final image that may be very different from the one seen in the viewfinder.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/03BE1551-8124-4788-A7D4-1218F87DDE18-140.png" width="130" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The A-Z of Creative Photography: Over 70 Techniques Explained in Full</div><span class="creator">Lee Frost</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0817433139</span><span class="description">For serious amateur photographers who alraedy shoot perfectly focused, accurately exposed images but want to be more creative with a camera, here's the book to consult.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/BFAAE5B1-839E-4010-9B03-A23FBE9C175F-140.png" width="114" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Complete Guide to Night and Low-Light Photography</div><span class="creator">Lee Frost</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">0817450416</span><span class="description">Aimed at photographers who pack away their cameras as soon as light levels fall, this brilliant book shows how, with just a little skill and imagination, even amateurs can produce breathtaking photographs in nighttime or low-light settings.

But where do fonts come from and why do we need so many? Who is behind the businesslike subtlety of Times New Roman, the cool detachment of Arial, or the maddening lightness of Comic Sans (and the movement to ban it)? Simon Garfield embarks on a mission to answer these questions and more, and reveal what may be the very best and worst fonts in the world.<br /><br />Typefaces are now 560 years old, but we barely knew their names until about twenty years ago, when the pull-down font menus on our first computers made us all the gods of type. Beginning in the early days of Gutenberg and ending with the most adventurous digital fonts, Garfield unravels our age old obsession with the way our words look. Just My Type investigates a range of modern mysteries, including how Helvetica took over the world, what inspires the seemingly ubiquitous use of Trajan on bad movie posters, and what makes a font look presidential, male or female, American, British, German, or Jewish. From the typeface of Beatlemania to the graphic vision of the Obama campaign, fonts can signal a musical revolution or the rise of an American president. This book is a must-read for the design conscious that will forever change the way you look at the printed word.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/59344878-0EC9-4ECD-84F7-7BDBE5D4124A-140.png" width="93" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">SQL Pocket Guide</div><span class="creator">Jonathan Gennick</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0596005121</span><span class="description">This pocket guide presents the most crucial information about SQL in a compact and easily accessible format, covering the four commonly used SQL variants—Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL.

Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within.<br /><br />Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<br /><br />In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.<br /><br />Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C6617197-FAE9-489E-BEA2-8D076BC08377-140.png" width="92" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Memoirs of a Geisha Uk</div><span class="creator">Arthur Golden</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0099771519</span><span class="description">This story is a rare and utterly engaging experience.

Ontological engineering refers to the set of activities concerning the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them. During the last decade, increasing attention has been focused on ontologies. Ontologies are now widely used in knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and computer science; in applications related to areas such as knowledge management, natural language processing, e-commerce, intelligent information integration, bio-informatics, education; and in new emerging fields like the semantic web. The book presents the major issues of ontological engineering and describes the most outstanding ontologies currently available. It covers the practical aspects of selecting and applying methodologies, languages, and tools for building ontologies.

Clojure's clean, careful design lets you write programs that get right to the essence of a problem, without a lot of clutter and ceremony.<br /><br />Clojure is Lisp reloaded. Clojure has the power inherent in Lisp, but is not constrained by the history of Lisp.<br /><br />Clojure is a functional language. Data structures are immutable, and functions tend to be side-effect free. This makes it easier to write correct programs, and to compose large programs from smaller ones.<br /><br />Clojure is concurrent. Rather than error-prone locking, Clojure provides software transactional memory.<br /><br />Clojure embraces Java. Calling from Clojure to Java is direct, and goes through no translation layer.<br /><br />Clojure is fast. Wherever you need it, you can get the exact same performance that you could get from hand-written Java code.<br /><br />Many other languages offer some of these features, but the combination of them all makes Clojure sparkle. Programming Clojure shows you why these features are so important, and how you can use Clojure to build powerful programs quickly.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D71ECF15-C744-48CA-9DC0-19A3E13E2F51-140.png" width="118" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">C++ Standard Library From Scratch</div><span class="creator">Pablo Halpern</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">0789721287</span><span class="description">C++ Standard Library From Scratch walks you through the analysis, design and implementation of a functioning personal information manager (PIM) using strings, streams, and the Standard Template Library.

It is set in Burgdorf, a small fictional German town, between 1915 and 1951. The protagonist is Trudi Montag, a Zwerg — the German word for dwarf woman. As a dwarf she is set apart, the outsider whose physical "otherness" has a corollary in her refusal to be a part of Burgdorf's silent complicity during and after World War II. Trudi establishes her status and power, not through beauty, marriage, or motherhood, but rather as the town's librarian and relentless collector of stories.<br />Through Trudi's unblinking eyes, we witness the growing impact of Nazism on the ordinary townsfolk of Burgdorf as they are thrust on to a larger moral stage and forced to make choices that will forever mark their lives. Stones from the River is a story of secrets, parceled out masterfully by Trudi — and by Ursula Hegi — as they reveal the truth about living through unspeakable times.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6608837B-8E90-40B2-901C-52FFD173953D-140.png" width="93" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Gregory Heisler: 50 Portraits: Stories and Techniques from a Photographer's Photographer</div><span class="creator">Gregory Heisler</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0823085651</span><span class="description">In this first-ever showcase of his work, Gregory Heisler, one of professional photography's most respected practitioners, shares 50 iconic portraits of celebrities, athletes, and world leaders, along with fascinating, thoughtful, often humorous stories about how the images were made.

Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from "the good fight," For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. "If the function of a writer is to reveal reality," Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, "no one ever so completely performed it." Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author's previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/DFE71FF8-EE13-46D9-8B15-17560FDAE2FC-140.png" width="92" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Photographing Fireworks: The Right Gear, Location, and Techniques for Capturing Beautiful Images</div><span class="creator">Alan Hess</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin"></span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A8507CB7-B0BC-4E9D-9BE5-A565B74A49BF-140.png" width="90" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Computer Graphics Using Open GL</div><span class="creator">Francis S.

Even though the specification is still in development, many modern browsers and mobile devices already support HTML5 and CSS3. This book gets you up to speed on the new HTML5 elements and CSS3 features you can use right now, and backwards compatible solutions ensure that you don't leave users of older browsers behind.<br /><br />This book gets you started working with many useful new features of HTML5 and CSS3 right away. Gone are the days of adding additional markup just to style a button differently or stripe tables. You'll learn to use HTML5's new markup to create better structure for your content and better interfaces for your forms, resulting in cleaner, easier-to-read code that can be understood by both humans and programs.<br /><br />You'll find out how to embed audio, video, and vector graphics into your pages without using Flash. You'll see how web sockets, client-side storage, offline caching, and cross-document messaging can ease the pain of modern web development. And you'll discover how simple CSS3 makes it to style sections of your page. Throughout the book, you'll learn how to compensate for situations where your users can't take advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 yet, developing solutions that are backwards compatible and accessible.<br /><br />You'll find what you need quickly with this book's modular structure, and get hands-on with a tutorial project for each new HTML5 and CSS3 feature covered. "Falling Back" sections show you how to create solutions for older browsers, and "The Future" sections at the end of each chapter get you excited about the possibilities when HTML5 and CSS3 reach widespread adoption.

He explores the wit behind Poor Richard's Almanac and the wisdom behind the Declaration of Independence, the new nation's alliance with France, the treaty that ended the Revolution, and the compromises that created a near-perfect Constitution.<br />Above all, Isaacson shows how Franklin's unwavering faith in the wisdom of the common citizen and his instinctive appreciation for the possibilities of democracy helped to forge an American national identity based on the virtues and values of its middle class.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/7C0F246E-B6F6-41B2-88F3-2B3263A6AD38-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Steve Jobs</div><span class="creator">Walter Isaacson</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1451648537</span><span class="description">Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.<br /><br />At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br /><br />Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br /><br />Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/F37AD048-7295-4DF2-A45D-4D6E66D0317D-140.png" width="98" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Popular Mechanics Home How-To</div><span class="creator">Albert Jackson, David Day</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0688085121</span><span class="description">This home maintenance book is filled with practical advice on how to save money, time, and aggravation on everything from plumbing to color schemes.

Rod Johnson believes that the problem lies not in J2EE itself, but in that it is often used badly. Many J2EE publications advocate approaches that, while fine in theory, often fail in reality, or deliver no real business value.<br /><br />Expert One-on-One: J2EE Design and Development aims to demystify J2EE development. Using a practical focus, it shows how to use J2EE technologies to reduce, rather than increase, complexity. Rod draws on his experience of designing successful high-volume J2EE applications and salvaging failing projects, as well as intimate knowledge of the J2EE specifications, to offer a real-world, how-to guide on how you too can make J2EE work in practice.<br /><br />It will help you to solve common problems with J2EE and avoid the expensive mistakes often made in J2EE projects. It will guide you through the complexity of the J2EE services and APIs to enable you to build the simplest possible solution, on time and on budget. Rod takes a practical, pragmatic approach, questioning J2EE orthodoxy where it has failed to deliver results in practice and instead suggesting effective, proven approaches.<br /><br />What does this book cover?<br /><br />In this book, you will learn When to use a distributed architectureWhen and how to use EJBHow to develop an efficient data access strategyHow to design a clean and maintainable web interfaceHow to design J2EE applications for performance<br /><br />Who is this book for?<br /><br />This book would be of value to most enterprise developers. Although some of the discussion (for example, on performance and scalability) would be most relevant to architects and lead developers, the practical focus would make it useful to anyone with some familiarity with J2EE. Because of the complete design-deployment coverage, a less advanced developer could work through the book along with a more introductory text, and successfully build and understand the sample application. This comprehensive coverage would also be useful to developers in smaller organisations, who might be called upon to fill several normally distinct roles.<br /><br />What is special about this book?<br /><br />Wondering what differentiates this book from others like it in the market? Take a look: It does not just discuss technology, but stress its practical application. The book is driven from the need to solve common tasks, rather than by the elements of J2EE.It discuss risks in J2EE developmentIt takes the reader through the entire design, development and build process of a non-trivial application. This wouldn't be compressed into one or two chapters, like the Java Pet Store, but would be a realistic example comparable to the complexity of applications readers would need to build.At each point in the design, alternative choices would be discussed. This would be important both where there's a real problem with the obvious alternative, and where the obvious alternatives are perhaps equally valid.It emphasizes the use of OO design and design patterns in J2EE, without becoming a theoretical book</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/296BA9EB-58DD-498D-B845-61EEA9254752-140.png" width="112" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Parliamentary Procedure at a Glance: New Edition</div><span class="creator">O.

Java developers have been particularly fortunate in this area, having been able to take advantage of Grails, an open source framework that supercharges productivity when building Java–driven web sites. Grails is based on Groovy, which is a very popular and growing dynamic scripting language for Java developers and was inspired by Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.<br /><br />Beginning Groovy and Grails is the first introductory book on the Groovy language and its primary web framework, Grails.<br /><br />This book gets you started with Groovy and Grails and culminates in the example and possible application of some real–world projects. You follow along with the development of each project, implementing and running each application while learning new features along the way. What you’ll learn Understand the fundamentals of the open source, dynamic Groovy scripting language and the Grails web framework.Capitalize upon Grails’ well–defined framework architecture to build web applications faster than ever before.Improve your web application with cutting–edge interface enhancements using Ajax.Use Grails’ object–relational mapping solution, GORM, to manage your data store more effectively than ever before.Take advantage of Groovy to create reporting services, implement batch processing, and create alternative client interfaces.Deploy and upgrade your Grails–driven applications with expertise and ease.Discover an alternative client in Groovy as well.Who this book is for<br /><br />Java and web developers looking to learn and embrace the power and flexibility offered by the Grails framework and Groovy scripting language.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5D5A1D26-FBB3-4D0A-972B-FBBC6BF7AC91-140.png" width="108" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Implementing Responsive Design: Building sites for an anywhere, everywhere web</div><span class="creator">Tim Kadlec</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321821688</span><span class="description">New devices and platforms emerge daily.

You see everything from the complete lighting setup (and all the gear used), to the shoot (including all the camera settings and a contact sheet of the progression of the shoot), to the all-important part that most books don’t dare include–the post-processing and retouching in Photoshop. This book also breaks new ground in the visual way it teaches you the lighting setup. There aren’t any sketches or 3D models–you see the lighting layout in a full-page photo, taken from above during the live shoot, so you can see exactly where everything’s positioned (the subject, the photographer, the lighting, the background–you name it–you see it all). Plus, you’ll see side, over-the-shoulder, and more behind-the-scenes views, so you can absolutely nail the lighting every time.<br /><br />LEARN THE LIGHTING SETUPS THE PROS USE<br />Each year, Scott trains thousands of professional photographers during his Light It.

Sony introduces hip portable music with the Walkman, Illinois Bell Company releases the first mobile phone, Space Invaders kicks off the video game craze, and William Kent writes Data and Reality. We have made amazing progress in the last four decades in terms of portable music, mobile communication, and entertainment, making devices such as the original Sony Walkman and suitcase-sized mobile phones museum pieces today. Yet remarkably, the book Data and Reality is just as relevant to the field of data management today as it was in 1978.<br /><br />Data and Reality gracefully weaves the disciplines of psychology and philosophy with data management to create timeless takeaways on how we perceive and manage information. Although databases and related technology have come a long way since 1978, the process of eliciting business requirements and how we think about information remains constant. This book will provide valuable insights whether you are a 1970s data-processing expert or a modern-day business analyst, data modeler, database administrator, or data architect.<br /><br />This third edition of Data and Reality differs substantially from the first and second editions. Data modeling thought leader Steve Hoberman has updated many of the original examples and references and added his commentary throughout the book, including key points at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />The important takeaways in this book are rich with insight yet presented in a conversational writing style. Here are just a few of the issues this book tackles: Has "business intelligence" replaced "artificial intelligence"?Why is a map's geographic landscape analogous to a data model's information landscape?Where do forward and reverse engineering fit in our thought process?Why are we all becoming "data archeologists"?What causes the communication chasm between the business professional and the information technology professional, and how can the logical data model bridge this gap?Why do we invest in hardware and software to solve business problems before determining what the business problems are in the first place?What is the difference between oneness, sameness, and categories?Why does context play a role in every design decision?Why do the more important attributes become entities or relationships?Why do symbols speak louder than words?What's the difference between a data modeler, a philosopher, and an artist?Why is the 1975 dream of mapping all attributes still a dream today?What influence does language have on our perception of reality?Can we distinguish between naming and describing?<br /><br />From Graeme Simsion's foreword:<br />While such fundamental issues remain unrecognized and unanswered, Data and Reality, with its lucid and compelling elucidation of the questions, needs to remain in print. I read the book as a database administrator in 1980, as a researcher in 2002, and just recently as the manuscript for the present edition. On each occasion I found something more, and on each occasion I considered it the most important book I had read on data modeling. It has been on my recommended reading list forever. The first chapter in particular should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in data modeling.<br /><br />In publishing this new edition, Steve Hoberman has not only ensured that one of the key books in the data modeling canon remains in print, but has added his own comments and up-to-date examples, which are likely to be helpful to those who have come to data modeling more recently. Don't do any more data modeling work until you've read it.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/8556EB39-E5C1-483C-BAC4-1D42C393684E-140.png" width="90" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Refactoring to Patterns</div><span class="creator">Joshua Kerievsky</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">0321213351</span><span class="description">In 1994, Design Patterns changed the landscape of object-oriented development by introducing classic solutions to recurring design problems. In 1999, Refactoring revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly anticipated Refactoring to Patterns, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring.<br /><br />This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.<br /><br />Coverage includes: A catalog of twenty-seven pattern-directed refactorings, featuring real-world code examplesDescriptions of twelve design smells that indicate the need for this book’s refactoringsGeneral information and new insights about patterns and refactoringDetailed implementation mechanics: how low-level refactorings are combined to implement high-level patternsMultiple ways to implement the same pattern–and when to use eachPractical ways to get started even if you have little experience with patterns or refactoring<br /><br />Refactoring to Patterns reflects three years of refinement and the insights of more than sixty software engineering thought leaders in the global patterns, refactoring, and agile development communities.

The book makes no assumptions about prior experience with object-oriented programming languages or with the C language (which Objective-C is based upon). Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language.  <br />This unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study.      This edition has been fully updated for the significant changes in iOS 5 and Xcode 4.2. One of the biggest changes is Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). This edition gives detailed coverage of how to use ARC to improve and simplify memory management in Objective-C programs.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/FF5AFE62-EE8B-437C-B5DB-C5DE42BF60CB-140.png" width="109" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Ruminations on C++: A Decade of Programming Insight and Experience</div><span class="creator">Andrew Koenig, Barbara E.

Julieanne Kost, a Photoshop and creative thinking expert, has taken her own experience shooting images out of commercial airplane windows to create a unique creative seminar.<br /><br />The first section of the book, The Art of Creative Thinking: The Principles, outlines Julieanne's method for staying creative in an increasingly complicated world. In her personal stories, advice, and philosophies, you'll find inspiration if you're stuck or just can't get started. You may recognize some of your own less-than-productive thought processes as she describes her own struggle to let go of the everyday flotsam of life to find a quiet mental space in which she can think, dream, and create.<br /><br />The second part of the book, Window Seat: The Portfolio, is a collection of images culled from over 3000 photographs Julieanne shot from commercial airplane windows over a period of five years. The photographs are accompanied by brief commentaries addressing various aspects of the process, from the original inspiration to issues of control, subject matter, image selection, and manipulation.<br /><br />The Appendix contains technical information: a discussion of the equipment and media Julieanne used to shoot the photos; how she processed the photographs using Adobe Camera Raw; the Photoshop techniques she employed to correct, retouch, and manipulate the images; her personal file management system; and how she prepares her files for printing.<br /><br />This book is essential reading for photographers and artists looking for ways to stay creatively awake, aware, and alive.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/9DBC78A1-5A48-4D70-BEFA-16FEED88BB6F-140.png" width="140" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Developing Microsoft ASP.NET Server Controls and Components</div><span class="creator">Nikhil Kothari, Vandana Datye</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">0735615829</span><span class="description">This comprehensive guide combines conceptual and architectural details with practical, how-to information and real-world code samples to show how to create custom, reusable, professional-quality server controls with rich design-time functionality.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D9227FDC-AC87-48E8-90BC-539C82475888-140.png" width="115" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Processing Disorder, Revised Edition</div><span class="creator">Carol Kranowitz</span><span class="rating">4.5</span><span class="asin">0399531653</span><span class="description">NEWLY REVISED AND UPDATED<br /><br />The Out-of-Sync Child broke new ground by identifying Sensory Processing Disorder, a common but frequently misdiagnosed problem in which the central nervous system misinterprets messages from the senses.

Based on the rationale that once a student understands the applications of networks they can understand the network services needed to support these applications, this book takes a "top-down" approach where students are first exposed to a concrete application and then drawn into some of the deeper issues of networking. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet focuses on the Internet as opposed to addressing it as just one of many computer network technologies. Students are enormously curious about what is "under the hood" of the Internet, creating an extremely motivational vehicle for teaching fundamental computer networking concepts.

In this primer on leadership and innovation, the author will introduce readers to concepts like the "DRI" (Apple's practice of assigning a Directly Responsible Individual to every task) and the Top 100 (an annual ritual in which 100 up-and-coming executives are tapped a la Skull &amp; Bones for a secret retreat with company founder Steve Jobs).<br /><br />Based on numerous interviews, the book offers exclusive new information about how Apple innovates, deals with its suppliers and is handling the transition into the Post Jobs Era. Lashinsky, a Senior Editor at Large for Fortune, knows the subject cold: In a 2008 cover story for the magazine entitled The Genius Behind Steve: Could Operations Whiz Tim Cook Run The Company Someday he predicted that Tim Cook, then an unknown, would eventually succeed Steve Jobs as CEO.<br /><br />While Inside Apple is ostensibly a deep dive into one, unique company (and its ecosystem of suppliers, investors, employees and competitors), the lessons about Jobs, leadership, product design and marketing are universal. They should appeal to anyone hoping to bring some of that Apple magic to their own company, career, or creative endeavor.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/92703916-8BB3-43EC-858D-9BFC3D029EB2-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Environmental Portraiture: Tell Your Subject's Story and Create Dynamic Portraits with One Bag of Gear</div><span class="creator">Kathleen Lavine</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin"></span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/96E1BFAD-C99B-405C-89ED-E832044B510F-140.png" width="90" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Concurrent Programming in Java</div><span class="creator">Doug Lea</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0201310090</span><span class="description">In this second edition, you will find thoroughly updated coverage of the Java(tm) 2 platform and new or expanded coverage of:<br /><br />* Memory model * Cancellation * Portable parallel programming * Utility classes for concurrency control<br /><br />The Java platform provides a broad and powerful set of APIs, tools, and technologies. One of its most powerful capabilities is the built-in support for threads. This makes concurrent programming an attractive yet challenging option for programmers using the Java programming language.<br /><br />This book shows readers how to use the Java platform's threading model more precisely by helping them to understand the patterns and tradeoffs associated with concurrent programming.<br /><br />You will learn how to initiate, control, and coordinate concurrent activities using the class java.lang.Thread, the keywords synchronized and volatile, and the methods wait, notify, and notifyAll. In addition, you will find detailed coverage of all aspects of concurrent programming, including such topics as confinement and synchronization, deadlocks and conflicts, state-dependent action control, asynchronous message passing and control flow, coordinated interaction, and structuring web-based and computational services.<br /><br />The book targets intermediate to advanced programmers interested in mastering the complexities of concurrent programming. Taking a design pattern approach, the book offers standard design techniques for creating and implementing components that solve common concurrent programming challenges. The numerous code examples throughout help clarify the subtleties of the concurrent programming concepts discussed.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/FEA8CB33-00A0-43F8-8FA8-EAC0AE247A74-140.png" width="113" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Journey to Data Quality</div><span class="creator">Yang W.

Neither ad hoc approaches nor fixes at the systems level—installing the latest software or developing an expensive data warehouse—solve the basic problem of bad data quality practices. Journey to Data Quality offers a roadmap that can be used by practitioners, executives, and students for planning and implementing a viable data and information quality management program. This practical guide, based on rigorous research and informed by real-world examples, describes the challenges of data management and provides the principles, strategies, tools, and techniques necessary to meet them.<br /><br />The authors, all leaders in the data quality field for many years, discuss how to make the economic case for data quality and the importance of getting an organization's leaders on board. They outline different approaches for assessing data, both subjectively (by users) and objectively (using sampling and other techniques). They describe real problems and solutions, including efforts to find the root causes of data quality problems at a healthcare organization and data quality initiatives taken by a large teaching hospital. They address setting company policy on data quality and, finally, they consider future challenges on the journey to data quality.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/28D7BE88-475D-4E68-8902-F14315D975AF-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Swag: A Novel</div><span class="creator">Elmore Leonard</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B009R55IFG</span><span class="description">The smallest of small-time criminals, Ernest Stickley Jr. figures his luck's about to change when Detroit used car salesman Frank Ryan catches him trying to boost a ride from Ryan's lot.

Your competition is smart, tech-savvy, and highly resourceful. Expectations among employers are higher. Your competition will run you over if you're not up to the challenge. Land the Tech Job You Love gives you the background, the skills, and the hard-won wisdom to bypass the mistakes of those who don't prepare.<br /><br />You might not think you need this book. Conventional Wisdom has it that finding a job is simple: send some resumes, go on some interviews, and take the offer that sounds best. But that's only the start. You've got the background and skills to work the Web and other resources that the general job seeker doesn't. This book shows you how to take advantage of those skills or be left behind by competing techies who do.<br /><br />It all starts with an examination of you, your strengths, and where you want your career to take you. Without a roadmap, you'll wind up in any old job. Life's too short to spend in a job that you don't love. From there, you'll see how to find the job you want that fits you and the employer, using your technical and web savvy to find the hidden jobs that never make it into the classifieds or Monster.<br /><br />"Marketing" is not a dirty word, and you'll learn how to present yourself, your skills, and your background in the way that shows the hiring company that you're the right person for the job. Create a resume that tosses out conventional wisdom, write cover letters that sell your background, and assemble a portfolio of work that will wow the interviewer.<br /><br />Social networking has been the darling of the Web in the past few years, but it's no substitute for the sort of personal interaction that makes relationships that help in future careers. As one manager said, "One recommendation is worth a million resumes." This book shows you how to make and maintain the connections that will drive your future career moves.<br /><br />Land the Tech Job You Love pulls no punches and lays out the details for what gets you an interview, and gets you hired in a job in the technical world that makes you happy.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/65C70533-E5F9-40BE-B127-464DE69C13F4-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Where the Heart Is</div><span class="creator">Billie Letts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0446672211</span><span class="description">Talk about unlucky sevens.

See Lindberg’s Spirit of St Louis and John Glen’s Mercury Spacecraft.<br /><br />The Corcoran Gallery is the largest nonfederal museum in Washington DC. Its popularity stems from its stellar list of artists represented like Renoir, de Kooning, Picasso, Calder, Whistler, and Sargent.<br /><br />In addition to seeing art, any trip to the Mid-Atlantic and Washington DC should include a visit to the great memorials and monuments on the National Mall. The US Capitol and Lincoln Memorial are at either end of the Mall; in between them are the great memorials to Washington and Jefferson. They are impressive architecturally and laid out in a way to inspire pride and patriotism.<br /><br />The ARTWISE® Washington DC Museum Map is a detailed map of central Washington DC culturally speaking. The index lists and describes museums and other cultural sites with the address, map reference, hours, telephone, admission charge information and a brief description of the highlights of that location.

The City of Light, the City of Love and the City of Romance, familiar platitudes, but once you experience it for yourself you understand why. There is a je ne sais quoi allure to this city that beguiles, but never completely reveals what makes it so universally appealing. Artists, poets, writers, and composers have tried to define exactly what it is about this place, and yet they succeed only to a point. Perhaps it is as elusive as defining love, for to be in Paris entails experiencing love, about someone, something, some place.<br /><br />There is so much to do - you know the big ones, the Louvre, Musee d’Orsay, Sacre Coeur, St. Germain des Pres, the Left Bank, the Right Bank, the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elysées, the Opéra- but don’t miss the fun of discovering the small ones, the ones off the beaten path. Nothing like taking your time strolling thru the turn of the century mansion that houses Musée Marmottan then enjoying a café and patisserie in the museums jewel box café.<br /><br />Wandering aimlessly is romantic. Getting lost isn’t romantic. In fact there are few things that can drain the romance out of a situation faster than realizing that you’re hopelessly lost. So take your travel map and put it away if you want to wander, but have no fear that your wandering will turn into a lost odyssey. You can always pull out the STREETWISE® Paris Map and get yourself pointed back in the right direction.<br /><br />Paris is not without faults. Sometimes people can be rude, but that’s the case anywhere in the world - be it a large city or small village. You get what you give. And in the case of Paris, as with any true love, you accept the flaws with the charms, the weaknesses with the strengths. In the end the true beauty of Paris will surpass any blemish. Life from a Parisian perspective is beautiful. But that’s another cliché, isn’t it?<br /><br />Our pocket size map of Paris is laminated for durability and accordion folding for effortless use.

The Mall serves as center field, with Lincoln, Jefferson, the WWII and Vietnam Memorials on one end, reminding us of the past battles this city has seen, and Congress, confronting current issues, looming at the other end. In between, the White House stands ready to take the field while the Supreme Court sits back waiting to settle the inevitable skirmishes that arise. Surrounding them are the supporting players, the Treasury, The Library of Congress and all the various Departments that run every feasible aspect of public life. Meanwhile, Washington Cathedral stands ready to console the battered and bereaved.<br /><br />All of this is clearly laid out for you on our STREETWISE® Washington DC Street Map.

By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of "why I did stand-up and why I walked away."<br /><br />Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been awriter. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written.<br /><br />At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes.<br /><br />Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times — the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.<br /><br />Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6CE6649F-CE0F-4EA6-B8F4-17896ACE1969-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Designed for Use: Create Usable Interfaces for Applications and the Web</div><span class="creator">Lukas Mathis</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1934356751</span><span class="description">In this book for designers, developers, and product managers, expert developer and user interface designer Lukas Mathis explains how to make usability the cornerstone of every point in your design process, walking you through the necessary steps to plan the design for an application or website, test it, and get usage data after the design is complete.

Designing technologies and systems to provide optimal sensory information to human users will be increasingly important. But to do this, quantitative relationships between brain behavior at a molecular level and observable human behavior must be better identified. This was previously considered to be a futuristic, and somewhat unrealistic, goal, however, recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have provided new opportunities for researchers.<br /><br />Refinements in imaging technology and simulation tools, and the learning yielded from them, provided the Quantifying Human Information Processing (QHIP) research teams strong starting points from which to further assess the ability to quantify human information processing. Led by experts in psychology, cognitive science, and information processing, among other fields, researchers sought to quantify the information flow in the nervous system, the limits of that flow, and how it is affected by emotions. The QHIP effort looked at specific aspects of the brain's information processing ability including measuring task-related and unrelated thought, assessing mental workload, and finding optimal information processing.<br /><br />The researchers found important indicators of both the capacity and limits of the human brain, and offer new ways to think about the brain. This work is a valuable contribution to the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cognition, and will serve as a resource for human factors engineers designing the next generation of information, safety, analysis, and control systems because it starts to answer how to maximize information processing without overloading the central nervous system.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B076CAB8-3E8C-4AF2-B38F-D3BF9A6E4C67-140.png" width="93" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets and Solutions, Sixth Edition</div><span class="creator">Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz</span><span class="rating">3.5</span><span class="asin">0071613749</span><span class="description">The world's bestselling computer security book—fully expanded and updated<br /><br />"Right now you hold in your hand one of the most successful security books ever written.

A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape.<br /><br />And now we have 'Tis, the story of Frank's American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this "classless country," and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank's incomparable voice — his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue — that renders these experiences spellbinding.<br /><br />When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should "stick to their own kind" once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach — and to write — that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angela's Ashes comes of age.<br /><br />As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angela's Ashes, "It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best." Frank McCourt's 'Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B7CC44F2-C295-455A-AA00-C22204700F7B-140.png" width="101" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">1776</div><span class="creator">David McCullough</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0743226720</span><span class="description">In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence — when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.<br /><br />Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.<br /><br />At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books — Nathanael Greene, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of winter.<br /><br />But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost — Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B7C67338-E2AD-432B-AE9C-3F9FE311E08C-140.png" width="92" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">CSS: The Missing Manual</div><span class="creator">David Sawyer McFarland</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0596802447</span><span class="description">Cascading Style Sheets can turn humdrum websites into highly-functional, professional-looking destinations, but many designers merely treat CSS as window-dressing to spruce up their site's appearance.

He knows how to talk about it, shape it, color it, control it, and direct it. Most importantly, he knows how to create it...using small hot shoe flashes.<br /><br />In The Hot Shoe Diaries, Joe brings you behind the scenes to candidly share his lighting solutions for a ton of great images. Using Nikon Speedlights, Joe lets you in on his uncensored thought processâoften funny, sometimes serious, always fascinatingâto demonstrate how he makes his pictures with these small flashes. Whether he’s photographing a gymnast on the Great Wall, an alligator in a swamp, or a fire truck careening through Times Square, Joe uses these flashes to create great light that makes his pictures sing.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/20A405A7-2374-4450-9C4F-11905E9E5043-140.png" width="124" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Moment It Clicks: Photography Secrets from One of the World's Top Shooters</div><span class="creator">Joe McNally</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321544080</span><span class="description">THE FIRST BOOK WITH ONE FOOT ON THE COFFEE TABLE, AND ONE FOOT IN THE<br />CLASSROOM<br />Joe McNally, one of the world’s top pro digital photographers, whose celebrated work has graced the pages of Sports Illustrated, Time, and National Geographic (to name a few), breaks new ground by doing something no photography book has ever done—blending the rich, stunning images and elegant layout of a coffee-table book with the invaluable training, no-nonsense insights, and photography secrets usually found only in those rare, best-of-breed educational books.<br /><br />When Joe’s not on assignment for the biggest-name magazines and Fortune 500 clients, he’s in the classroom teaching location lighting, environmental portraiture, and how to “get the shot” at workshops around the world. These on-location workshops are usually reserved for a handful of photographers each year, but now you can learn the same techniques that Joe shares in his seminars and lectures in a book that brings Joe’s sessions to life.<br /><br />What makes the book so unique is the “triangle of learning” where (1) Joe distills the concept down to one brief sentence. It usually starts with something like, “An editor at National Geographic once told me…” and then he shares one of those hard-earned tricks of the trade that you only get from spending a lifetime behind the lens. Then, (2) on the facing page is one of Joe’s brilliant images that perfectly illustrates the technique (you’ll recognize many of his photos from magazine covers). And (3) you get the inside story of how that shot was taken, including which equipment he used (lens, f/stop, lighting, accessories, etc.), along with the challenges that type of project brings, and how to set up a shot like that of your own.<br /><br />This book also gives you something more. It inspires. It challenges. It informs. But perhaps most importantly, it will help you understand photography and the art of making great photos at a level you never thought possible. This book is packed with those “Ah ha!” moments—those clever insights that make it all come together for you. It brings you that wonderful moment when it suddenly all makes sense—that “moment it clicks.”</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A313A2D2-A21D-437F-B808-D3109D74A949-140.png" width="138" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sketching Light: An Illustrated Tour of the Possibilities of Flash</div><span class="creator">Joe McNally</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321700902</span><span class="description">Following up on the great success of The Moment It Clicks and The Hot Shoe Diaries: Big Light from Small Flashes, legendary magazine photographer Joe McNally takes us on another memorable ride with Sketching Light, another trip into the land of light—but this time running the gamut from small flash to big flash, and everywhere in between.<br /><br />Of course, Joe includes coverage of Nikon Speedlights, but he also covers big flash, as well as "in-between" lights as the Elinchrom Quadra.

This book shows how to use both aesthetics and mechanics to design distinctive, cohesive web sites that "work." Most books on web development concentrate either on the aesthetics or the mechanics of a site. This book focuses on the framework that holds the two together. Information Architecture for the World Wide Web shows how to apply principles of architecture and library science to design web sites and intranets that are easy to use, manage, and expand. It's for novice designers who want to avoid the pitfalls of poorly designed sites; experienced designers who've created sites but realize something "is missing"; and programmers and administrators who are comfortable with HTML, CGI, and Java but want to organize their web pages into a cohesive site.

In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do–so you can leverage its immense, surprising power.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code–and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages.<br /><br /> <br /><br />A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Ruby will help you “put on your Ruby-colored glasses” and get results that make you a true believer.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/26A0EC0E-1FE7-4A6A-A691-873314FBA4E8-140.png" width="107" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Anil's Ghost: A Novel</div><span class="creator">Michael Ondaatje</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0375724370</span><span class="description">With his first novel since the internationally acclaimed The English Patient, Booker Prize—winning author Michael Ondaatje gives us a work displaying all the richness of imagery and language and the piercing emotional truth that we have come to know as the hallmarks of his writing.<br /><br />Anil’s Ghost transports us to Sri Lanka, a country steeped in centuries of tradition, now forced into the late twentieth century by the ravages of civil war.

Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance.<br /><br />"Wonder is the best kids' book of the year," said Emily Bazelon, senior editor at Slate.com and author of Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J.

This book combines their most significant poems in print with the authors themselves reading their poetry on audio CD. Poets range from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot and Dorothy Parker to Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, Sylvia Plath and Gwendolyn Brooks.<br /><br />The power of spoken poetry is at the heart of Poetry Speaks. Poetry is a vocal art, an art meant to be read aloud. Listening to a poem read aloud can be a transforming experience. Poetry Speaks not only introduces the finest work from some of the greatest poets who ever lived, it reintroduces the oral tradition of poetry.<br /><br />Poetry Speaks features over 40 poets in chapters each containing:<br />• The poems that are read by the poet on the audio CD<br />• Additional poems in print form to allow the reader to further explore the poet<br />• A short biography and photo of each poet<br />• Original manuscripts and letters for most of the featured poets<br />• An original essay for each poet written by today’s most influential poets, a veritable Who’s Who of poetry, including: Seamus Heaney on W.B.

If you're reasonably comfortable programming in any widely known language, you'll be able to jump into JavaScript in no time.<br /><br />Divided into six Parts, the book starts with JavaScript code patterns that are too often ignored by JavaScript coders. Part 2 presents several essential JavaScript tasks-DOM and CSS manipulations, plus event handling and timers-in a framework-agnostic way, using syntax from all the major flavors. Parts 3 and 4, respectively, hit JavaScript's best features for user interface functionality-tooltips, lightboxes, image processing, infinite scrolling, and more-and forms for receiving and validating input. Part 5 explores the client/server relationship, touching on cookies, JSON, and Ajax (same- and cross-domain). Part 6 uses JavaScript in mashups with Twitter, Flickr, and geo-related APIs.<br /><br />The appendices feature Christophe's two-page JavaScript cheat sheet, followed by hard-won tips on debugging even the most maddening JavaScript errors. Next is an even-handed assessment of the major frameworks used in the book and in most JavaScript shops today.

Thanks largely to its perceived difficulty, data preparation has traditionally taken a backseat to the more alluring question of how best to extract meaningful knowledge. But without adequate preparation of your data, the return on the resources invested in mining is certain to be disappointing.<br /><br />Dorian Pyle corrects this imbalance. A twenty-five-year veteran of what has become the data mining industry, Pyle shares his own successful data preparation methodology, offering both a conceptual overview for managers and complete technical details for IT professionals. Apply his techniques and watch your mining efforts pay off-in the form of improved performance, reduced distortion, and more valuable results.<br /><br />On the enclosed CD-ROM, you'll find a suite of programs as C source code and compiled into a command-line-driven toolkit. This code illustrates how the author's techniques can be applied to arrive at an automated preparation solution that works for you. Also included are demonstration versions of three commercial products that help with data preparation, along with sample data with which you can practice and experiment.<br /><br />* Offers in-depth coverage of an essential but largely ignored subject.<br />* Goes far beyond theory, leading you-step by step-through the author's own data preparation techniques.<br />* Provides practical illustrations of the author's methodology using realistic sample data sets.<br />* Includes algorithms you can apply directly to your own project, along with instructions for understanding when automation is possible and when greater intervention is required.<br />* Explains how to identify and correct data problems that may be present in your application.<br />* Prepares miners, helping them head into preparation with a better understanding of data sets and their limitations.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/E676692B-3AE6-41D8-BA7A-89F3E06CC5AF-140.png" width="112" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Database Management Systems</div><span class="creator">Raghu Ramakrishnan</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0072322063</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C28A477D-4238-4DFC-958D-F9843CADC382-140.png" width="110" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Clojure in Action</div><span class="creator">Amit Rathore</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1935182595</span><span class="description">Summary<br /><br />Clojure in Actionis a hands-on tutorial for the working programmer who has written code in a language like Java or Ruby, but has no prior experience with Lisp. It teaches Clojure from the basics to advanced topics using practical, real-world application examples. Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing and environment set-up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.<br /><br />About the Technology<br /><br />Clojure is a modern Lisp for the JVM, and it has the strengths you'd expect: first-class functions, macros, support for functional programming, and a Lisp-like, clean programming style. About this Book<br /><br />Clojure in Action is a practical guide focused on applying Clojure to practical programming challenges. You'll start with a language tutorial written for readers who already know OOP. Then, you'll dive into the use cases where Clojure really shines: state management, safe concurrency and multicore programming, first-class code generation, and Java interop.

Many answers that do exist depend upon time and circumstance.<br /><br />Systems Architecting of Organizations: Why Eagles Can't Swim tackles a very difficult dilemma: how do even highly respected organizations maintain their vaunted excellence, accommodate the new world of global communications, transportation, economics and multinational security, and still survive against stiff competition already in place? As they are finding out, depending upon the circumstances, the demands of excellence on the one hand, and of change on the other, can be cruelly irreconcilable.<br />This book does not just describe business strengths and weaknesses. First, it identifies potential weaknesses, then offers guidelines and insights to address them. Its approach is architectural and heuristic. Second, this book is about maintaining success in a dynamic world, not about achieving it in a static one; few are clear on what to do and not to do in the face of major change.<br /><br />Systems Architecting of Organizations: Why Eagles Can't Swim helps professionals gain new perspectives when reviewing their own organizations and to see problems and opportunities previously not apparent.<br /><br />Features</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/4ECBA2BE-3C50-4305-8B38-B1C25F6DD82A-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">I'm Married to a Millionaire, So Why am I in Therapy?</div><span class="creator">Rebecca Reese</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1936214482</span><span class="description">Against the backdrop of a millionaire existence comes the touching and inspirational story of one woman's struggle to find true happiness. On a grey and blustery day in the Fall of 2009, Becky Reese, age 39, found herself at the breaking point. She was exhausted, fed up, and angry—more angry than ever—at herself. Why didn't she feel happy? She led a charmed life. The wife of a very wealthy man, she could buy anything she wanted, and as the mother of five, she was definitely in her element. But something was missing. On that life-changing day, Becky started asking herself deep, powerful, soul-searching questions, sparking a journey within that would forever change her destiny. Now she's on a mission to empower other women—especially moms—to find their inner beauty and inner peace, and to live every day from the inside out.

But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the "Web" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book: Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies — the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in threepopular frameworks — Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it.

Now fully revised and updated, Robinson's renowned guide proves once again that learning about wine can be just as engaging as drinking it.<br /><br />Written in Robinson's trademark accessible style, the new How to Taste features thoroughly updated vintages and producers as well as up-and-coming wine regions and styles. Incorporating wines that are both easily obtainable and reasonably priced, Robinson's lessons are separated into complementary portions of theory and practice to help you both learn and taste your way to wine expertise.<br /><br />One of the world's best-loved authorities on wine, Robinson explains first how to get the most out of the flavor of your wine and food, and then about specific grapes and the wines themselves. By the time you finish the book, you will have learned how to recognize the most popular grape varieties from Chardonnay and Riesling to Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon, and why a good sparkling wine is always better than cheap champagne. You will discover how to judge sweetness, acidity, and fruitiness as well as the difference between the length and the weight of a wine. You will also be given practical advice for dealing with wine in the real world: how to choose from a wine list, organize your own wine tastings, and pair wines with specific foods.<br /><br />From the armchair to the wine shop and back to the table, How to Taste will transform anyone on any level into a confident connoisseur who can leave faltering sips behind and have fun along the way.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5EA53415-91FC-4224-8344-F6CDA2393B95-140.png" width="112" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Oxford Companion to Wine, 3rd Edition</div><span class="creator">Jancis Robinson</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">0198609906</span><span class="description">Published in 1994 to worldwide acclaim, the first edition of Jancis Robinson's seminal volume immediately attained legendary status, winning every major wine book award including the Glenfiddich and Julia Child/IACP awards, as well as writer and woman of the year accolades for its editor on both sides of the Atlantic. Combining meticulously-researched fact with refreshing opinion and wit, The Oxford Companion to Wine offers almost 4,000 entries on every wine-related topic imaginable, from regions and grape varieties to the owners, connoisseurs, growers, and tasters in wine through the ages; from viticulture and oenology to the history of wine.

Rodriguez's eloquent, impassioned, frighteningly vivid chronicle of his youth in Los Angeles in the late 60s and early 70s. Growing up in Watts and East L.A., Rodriguez joined his first gang at age 11 and was drawn into "la vida loca" - the crazy life. Gangs were "how we wove something out of the threads of nothing, " he remembers. By age 18, he was a veteran of gang warfare, police killings, drug overdoses, and suicides that had claimed 25 of his friends and had driven him and so many others to despair. In part, Rodriguez survived the violence and desperation of his youth by writing down his experiences. They were only woven into this astonishing book years later, when his son, Ramiro, joined a gang in Chicago where they now live. Always Running is packed with episode after episode of high drama, but within this honest and powerful depiction of social devastation, there is a father's impassioned message of understanding and hope to his son, and to thousands like him.

It enforces good design principles, consistency of code across your team (and across your organization), and proper release management.<br /><br />But Rails is more than a set of best practices. Rails makes it both fun and easy to turn out very cool web applications. Need Ajax support, so your web applications are highly interactive? Rails has it built in. Want an application that sends and receives e-mail? Built in. Supports internationalization and localization? Built in. Do you need applications with a REST-based interface (so they can interact with other RESTful applications with almost no effort on your part)? All built-in.<br /><br />With this book, you'll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they're versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There is extensive coverage of testing, and the rewritten Deployment chapter now covers Phusion Passenger.<br /><br />As with the previous editions of the book, we start with an extended tutorial that builds parts of an online store.

Sanger describes how Obama’s early idealism about fighting “a war of necessity” in Afghanistan quickly turned to fatigue and frustration, how the early hopes that the Arab Spring would bring about a democratic awakening slipped away, and how an effort to re-establish American power in the Pacific set the stage for a new era of tensions with the world’s great rising power, China. <br /><br />As the world seeks to understand the contours of the Obama Doctrine, Confront and Conceal is a fascinating, unflinching account of these complex years, in which the president and his administration have found themselves struggling to stay ahead in a world where power is diffuse and America’s ability to exert control grows ever more elusive.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/8F7F4981-AAD1-4B07-946A-7247542928F4-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Existentialism and Human Emotion</div><span class="creator">Jean-Paul Sartre</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0806509023</span><span class="description">Essay by Jean-Paul Sartre translated in English from French.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/36478087-BB49-4378-8EE3-00D3298CC8BB-140.png" width="92" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">C++: The Complete Reference</div><span class="creator">Herbert Schildt</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0078824761</span><span class="description">Herb Schildt is the world's best selling C++ author—over 2 million programming books sold!

CSS's compact file size helps web pages load quickly, and by allowing changes made in one place to be applied across the entire document, CSS can save hours of tedious changing and updating.<br /><br />But to leverage the full power of CSS, web authors first have to sift through CSS theory to find practical solutions that resolve real-world problems. Web authors can waste hours and earn ulcers trying to find answers to those all-too-common dilemmas that crop up with each project. The CSS Cookbook cuts straight through the theory to provide hundreds of useful examples and CSS code recipes that web authors can use immediately to format their web pages.<br /><br />The time saved by a single one of these recipes will make its cover price money well-spent. But the CSS Cookbook provides more than quick code solutions to pressing problems. The explanation that accompanies each recipe enables readers to customize the formatting for their specific purposes, and shows why the solution works, so you can adapt these techniques to other situations. Recipes range from the basics that every web author needs to code concoctions that will take your web pages to new levels.<br /><br />Reflecting CSS2, the latest specification, and including topics that range from basic web typography and page layout to techniques for formatting lists, forms, and tables, it is easy to see why the CSS Cookbook is regarded as an excellent companion to Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide and a must-have resource for any web author who has even considered using CSS.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/82D76A3B-161A-4C47-86A9-86A4AB974D4E-140.png" width="105" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Designing Web and Mobile Graphics: Fundamental concepts for web and interactive projects</div><span class="creator">Christopher Schmitt</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00B24G3UO</span><span class="description">Graphics are key to the user experience of online content, especially now that users are accessing that content on a multitude of devices: smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

Security is near the top of government and corporate agendas around the globe. Security-related stories appear on the front page everyday. How well though, do any of us truly understand what achieving real security involves? In Beyond Fear, Bruce Schneier invites us to take a critical look at not just the threats to our security, but the ways in which we're encouraged to think about security by law enforcement agencies, businesses of all shapes and sizes, and our national governments and militaries. Schneier believes we all can and should be better security consumers, and that the trade-offs we make in the name of security - in terms of cash outlays, taxes, inconvenience, and diminished freedoms - should be part of an ongoing negotiation in our personal, professional, and civic lives, and the subject of an open and informed national discussion. With a well-deserved reputation for original and sometimes iconoclastic thought, Schneier has a lot to say that is provocative, counter-intuitive, and just plain good sense. He explains in detail, for example, why we need to design security systems that don't just work well, but fail well, and why secrecy on the part of government often undermines security. He also believes, for instance, that national ID cards are an exceptionally bad idea: technically unsound, and even destructive of security. And, contrary to a lot of current nay-sayers, he thinks online shopping is fundamentally safe, and that many of the new airline security measure (though by no means all) are actually quite effective. A skeptic of much that's promised by highly touted technologies like biometrics, Schneier is also a refreshingly positive, problem-solving force in the often self-dramatizing and fear-mongering world of security pundits. Schneier helps the reader to understand the issues at stake, and how to best come to one's own conclusions, including the vast infrastructure we already have in place, and the vaster systems—some useful, others useless or worse—that we're being asked to submit to and pay for. Bruce Schneier is the author of seven books, including Applied Cryptography (which Wired called "the one book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published") and Secrets and Lies (described in Fortune as "startlingly lively...¦[a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use."). He is also Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Counterpane Internet Security, Inc., and publishes Crypto-Gram, one of the most widely read newsletters in the field of online security.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1DDD5B0E-CF9F-4672-B3E8-9F9AB7CF1302-140.png" width="114" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Security Patterns: Integrating Security and Systems Engineering</div><span class="creator">Markus Schumacher, Eduardo Fernandez-Buglioni, Duane Hybertson, Frank Buschmann, Peter Sommerlad</span><span class="rating">3.5</span><span class="asin">0470858842</span><span class="description">Most security books are targeted at security engineers and specialists.

It was also a weapon. Simplicity isn’t just a design principle at Apple—it’s a value that permeates every level of the organization. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. It’s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011. Thanks to Steve Jobs’s uncompromising ways, you can see Simplicity in everything Apple does: the way it’s structured, the way it innovates, and the way it speaks to its customers. It’s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory. As ad agency creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple’s resurrection, helping to create such critical marketing campaigns as Think different. By naming the iMac, he also laid the foundation for naming waves of i-products to come. Segall has a unique perspective, given his years of experience creating campaigns for other iconic tech companies, including IBM, Intel, and Dell. It was the stark contrast of Apple’s ways that made Segall appreciate the power of Simplicity—and inspired him to help others benefit from it. In Insanely Simple, you’ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You’ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster, sometimes saving millions in the process. You’ll also learn, for example, how to:<br />• Think Minimal: Distilling choices to a minimum brings clarity to a company and its customers—as Jobs proved when he replaced over twenty product models with a lineup of four.<br />• Think Small: Swearing allegiance to the concept of “small groups of smart people” raises both morale and productivity.<br />• Think Motion: Keeping project teams in constant motion focuses creative thinking on well-defined goals and minimizes distractions.<br />• Think Iconic: Using a simple, powerful image to symbolize the benefit of a product or idea creates a deeper impression in the minds of customers.<br />• Think War: Giving yourself an unfair advantage—using every weapon at your disposal—is the best way to ensure that your ideas survive unscathed.Segall brings Apple’s quest for Simplicity to life using fascinating (and previously untold) stories from behind the scenes. Through his insight and wit, you’ll discover how companies that leverage this power can stand out from competitors—and individuals who master it can become critical assets to their organizations.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/FB4F3CEE-55C4-4022-B5B8-3B3061C01503-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Mac Hacks: Tips &amp; Tools for unlocking the power of OS X</div><span class="creator">Chris Seibold</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1449325580</span><span class="description">Want to take real control of your Mac?

In this newly updated edition of his book, Jeffrey Simon reaches back to the founding days of the Republic to tell a story that is both instructive and alarming. Simon uncovers the dynamics of a deadly conflict that affects all Americans. His in-depth interviews with terrorists and their victims, with reporters, government officials, and others bring to life a tale of presidents and terrorists, media and society, all entangled in a drama of international violence.<br /><br />The Terrorist Trap traces the government response to terrorism from the days of Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates to William Jefferson Clinton's confrontation with homegrown terrorism. It explores the terrorist trap: the psychological, political, and social elements that make terrorism unlike any other conflict. With the end of the Cold War and the defeat of Saddam Hussein's army in the Gulf War, many believed that the threat of terrorism had been significantly reduced. But Simon shows how terrorism grows out of political, economic, and social grievances that can never be<br />fully resolved, as events in Israel and elsewhere continue to demonstrate. Living with terrorism will be an inescapable part of life in the twenty-first century. Simon calls on officials to move away from the useless rhetoric of defeating terrorism and to focus instead on achievable goals in combating this global problem.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C3F46949-4AF9-40D7-8FE6-D36B88310B2F-140.png" width="94" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Passionate Photographer: Ten Steps Toward Becoming Great</div><span class="creator">Steve Simon</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0321719891</span><span class="description">If you've got a love and passion for photography, a feel for your camera gear and settings, yet your images still fall short—The Passionate Photographer will help you close that disappointing and frustrating gap between the images you thought you took and the images you actually got.<br /><br />This book will encourage you to determine what you want to say with your photography, then translate those thoughts and feelings into strong images.

Studying biological systems is perhaps the best way to understand such networks, and nature has a lesson for us if we care to listen: bigger is rarely better in the long run. The deadliest creature is the mosquito, not the lion. It is the quality of a network that is important for survival, not the size, and all networks—the human brain, Facebook, Google, even the internet itself—eventually reach a breakpoint and collapse. That's the bad news. The good news is that reaching a breakpoint can be a step forward, allowing a network to substitute quality for quantity. <br /><br />In Breakpoint, brain scientist and entrepreneur Jeff Stibel takes readers to the intersection of the brain, biology, and technology. He shows how exceptional companies are using their understanding of the internet's brain-like powers to create a competitive advantage by building more effective websites, utilizing cloud computing, engaging social media, monetizing effectively, and leveraging a collective consciousness. Indeed, the result of these technologies is a more tightly connected world with capabilities far beyond the sum of our individual minds.

You'll learn the benefits of each of these models, when and how to use them, and what their limitations are.<br /><br />Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn how to avoid shared mutable state and how to write good, elegant, explicit synchronization-free programs so you can create easy and safe concurrent applications. The techniques you learn in this book will take you from dreading concurrency to mastering and enjoying it. Best of all, you can work with Java or a JVM language of your choice - Clojure, JRuby, Groovy, or Scala - to reap the growing power of multicore hardware.<br /><br />If you are a Java programmer, you'd need JDK 1.5 or later and the Akka 1.0 library. In addition, if you program in Scala, Clojure, Groovy or JRuby you'd need the latest version of your preferred language. Groovy programmers will also need GPars.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/67252730-C3C5-4C7D-B1DC-8F133048960E-140.png" width="98" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Programming Groovy: Dynamic Productivity for the Java Developer</div><span class="creator">Venkat Subramaniam</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1934356093</span><span class="description">The strength of Java is no longer in the language itself; it's in the Java Platform (the JVM, JDK, and rich frameworks and libraries).

But if one per year is good, how about Seven Languages in Seven Weeks? In this book you'll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, and Ruby. Whether or not your favorite language is on that list, you'll broaden your perspective of programming by examining these languages side-by-side. You'll learn something new from each, and best of all, you'll learn how to learn a language quickly.<br /><br />Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell. With Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven Languages hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages.<br /><br />For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly—for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them.<br /><br />Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.<br /><br />Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.<br /><br />It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/94B9E38B-35CF-49DB-A6E4-0BB4EEDA96AB-140.png" width="107" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">New York from the Air: An Architectural Heritage</div><span class="creator">John Tauranac</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0810981912</span><span class="description">From the street, New York is a bustling, familiar world.

A new section covers: the pioneering deep level water main 80 kilometres in length, much longer even than the Channel Tunnel; new power tunnels and the enormous substation beneath Leicester Square; new underground railways; glass fibre communication; and much more. Clearly, metropolitan man is burrowing as actively as ever. The London we know and see is only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the familiar surface lies an unknown city, a Hades of buried and forgotten rivers, sunken sewers, underground railways, pipes and passages, tubes and tunnels, crypts and cellars. These lifelines of the metropolis twist and turn hidden beneath the pavements of the city - fifteen hundred miles of Neo-Gothic sewers, a hundred miles of Neolithic rivers, eighty-two miles of tube tunnels, twelve miles of government tunnels and hundreds of thousands of miles of cables and pipes. Layer upon layer, they run their urgent errands, carrying people, delivering water, removing sewage, passing currents, sending messages, conveying parcels. Drawing extensively from the literature and visual archives of the underworld, London under London traces the history of the tunnellers and borers who have pierced the ground beneath the city for close on two thousand years. The authors trace the routes taken by man and nature, and enable us to follow them from the comfort of our armchairs. They can also tell us, gazetteer-style, exactly where we can get below and see the strange world which they depict, whom to ask for permission, and which of the public service authorities organizes trips underground.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/E9330C78-1A16-494D-B72D-4353D0429C49-140.png" width="107" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Testable JavaScript</div><span class="creator">Mark Ethan Trostler</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1449323391</span><span class="description">One skill that’s essential for any professional JavaScript developer is the ability to write testable code.

With busy, cluttered backgrounds and subjects who don’t know how to pose, how can you take control and get a great shot no matter the situation? In Picture Perfect Practice, photographer Roberto Valenzuela breaks down the craft of photography into three key elements–locations, poses, and execution–that you can use to unlock the photographic opportunities lying beneath every challenging situation.<br /><br />Valenzuela stresses the need for photographers to actively practice their craft every day–just like you would practice a musical instrument–in order to master the art of making great images. With chapters that offer practice exercises to strengthen your photographic abilities, you’ll learn how to approach a scene, break it down, and see your way to a great photograph. The Location section features chapters that cover symmetry, balance, framing, color elements, textures, and much more. The Posing section includes the Five Key Posing Techniques that Valenzuela uses every time he’s shooting people, as well as a complete list of poses and how to achieve, customize, and perfect them. The Execution portion, with sections like “Lighting through Direction” and “Simplicity through Subtraction,” reveals Valenzuela’s overall approach to getting the shot. The book also includes an inspiring and helpful chapter on deliberate practice techniques, where Valenzuela describes his system for practicing and analyzing his work, which leads to constant improvement as a photographer.<br /><br />If you’ve been frustrated and overwhelmed by the challenges of real-world locations, posing your subjects, or executing a great image–or if you simply want to become a better shooter but don’t know where to start–Picture Perfect Practice gives you the tools and information you need to finally become the kind of photographer you’ve always wanted to be: the kind who can confidently walk into any location, under any lighting condition, with any subject, and know that you can create astonishing photographs that have a timeless impact.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/9399BB3D-AB02-43E1-9A5C-D0C2F94C4943-140.png" width="112" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Art and Science of Web Design</div><span class="creator">Jeffrey Veen</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0789723700</span><span class="description">The Art &amp; Science of Web Design will help you understand the Web from the inside.

An open source technology that is available on most computer platforms, including Windows® and Mac OS® X, CVS is widely used to manage program code, web site content, and to track changes made to system configuration files. Multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. If two developers modify the same file, CVS enables both sets of changes to be merged together into one final file. Although CVS is a lifesaver in many development scenarios, it suffers from poor documentation. But with Essential CVS, developers can have it all: the order that CVS brings and the comprehensive documentation developers need.<br /><br />Essential CVS is a complete and easy-to-follow reference that helps programmers and system administrators apply order to the task of managing large quantities of documents. The book covers basic concepts and usage of CVS, and features a comprehensive reference for CVS commands—including a handy Command Reference Card for quick, on-the-job checks. The book also includes advanced information on all aspects of CVS that involve automation, logging, branching and merging, and "watches." Readers will find in-depth coverage of the following: Installing CVS and building your first repositoryBasic use of CVS, including importing projects, checking out projects, committing changes, and updating projectsTagging, branching and mergingWorking with multiple usersClients, operating systems, and IDEsRepository management and managing remote repositoriesProject administration, including bug tracking systems, enforcing log messages, history and annotation, and more.TroubleshootingVersion control is essential to maintaining order in any project, large or small.

Young</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00CTTFDZC</span><span class="description">We all want to be inspired, do great things and keep up our momentum of creativity, but we can’t always pull it out of thin air. Oftentimes inspration flows like a raging river, where ideas and energy never seem to end. But then there are those dreadful days, weeks, or even months when the river runs dry and inspiration is not to be found. Something—or someone—needs to give a little push in the right direction to get those juices flowing again, and who’s to say that someone can’t be you?<br /><br />The best part about inspiration is that it can come from almost anything. Maybe you see a beautiful bird while out on a walk. Its bold colors inspire you to create a painting, or implement that palette into a design project. Or perhaps you walk past a bakery. The smell of bread stimulates your senses, making you think of your childhood, which then fires another part of your brain to write a poem or a blog post. The possibilities of where and how you can be inspired are endless.<br /><br />Consider this eBook your guide on the path of seeking inspiration. We’re not always certain of what we’re going to find on our journey, which, in a way, makes it even more adventurous. The key is to keep looking. Inspiration is out there. Sometimes we just have to go searching for it.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/15AEE44B-893D-4BCF-9871-FAD752B06834-140.png" width="86" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Tips from a Pro: Travel Photography</div><span class="creator">Nicole S.
