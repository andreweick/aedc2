Each artist was commissioned to create a new Flash movie, to explain the how and the why, and finally, to swap files and remix each other's works.<br /><br />All four authors are expert in combining Flash and Photoshop to create stunning effects, but any similarities end there. Jeremy Tai Abbett – creator of Suture.comArron Bleasdale – creator of Reforms.netKaren Ingram – creator of Krening.comFrancine Spiegel – creator of Tenderoni.com<br /><br />Between them, the four authors represent the vast diversity of styles and approaches possible when the time-based animation of Flash is combined with the static, layered images from Photoshop to create intricate, inventive, animated environments and reactive effects. Their detailed explanations of how each piece was created form an invaluable primer in a wide range of techniques and skills.<br /><br />This book and the accompanying website immerse the reader in the four phases of the 4x4 process: Theory: personal accounts of the creative process, manifestos, diaries, mental sketchbooks, and associated ephemera"Time and Stasis": access to the finished original Flash movies online, and stunning artwork from the pieces presented in the bookProcess: detailed, first-hand technical descriptions of the creation of each piece, along with original source files on the web siteNoise and interference: the four authors discuss, sample and remix each other's works</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/31715FE8-792E-4A02-A021-3E88605F7142-140.png" width="127" height="140" /></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">C# 3.0 in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference</div><span class="creator">Joseph Albahari, Ben Albahari</span><span class="rating">5</span><span class="asin">0596527578</span><span class="description">This is a concise yet thorough reference to C# 3.0 programming as implemented in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2008. C# 3.0 in a Nutshell gets right to the point, covering the essentials of language syntax and usage as well as the parts of the .NET base class libraries you need to build working applications. But unlike earlier editions, this book is now organized entirely around concepts and use cases, providing greater depth and readability.<br /><br />C# 3.0 introduces the most significant enhancements yet to the programming language, and C# 3.0 in a Nutshell delves deep into the subject while assuming minimal prior knowledge of C#-making it accessible to anyone with a reasonable background in programming. In addition to the language, the book covers the .NET CLR and the core Framework assemblies, along with the unified querying syntax called Language Integrated Query (LINQ), which bridges the traditional divide between programs and their data sources.<br /><br />Free of clutter and long introductions, this book provides a map of C# 3.0 knowledge in a succinct and unified style: Opening chapters concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types and variables, and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives<br /><br />Later chapters cover the core .NET 3.5 Framework, including such topics as LINQ, XML, collections, I/O and networking, memory management, reflection, attributes, security, threading, application domains and native interoperability<br /><br />Designed as a handbook for daily use, C# 3.0 in a Nutshell is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus on an applied technology such as WPF, ASP.NET, or WCF. The areas of the language and .NET Framework that such books omit, this one covers in detail.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1D3FCD99-C131-403E-BA5B-2E2AFAE03AC1-140.png" width="95" height="140" /></div></div></td>
