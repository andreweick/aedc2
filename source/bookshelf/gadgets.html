BOLT is designed to replace your standard wall charger and will automatically charge with your phone and be ready to go when you are. This makes BOLT a true grab and go solution. Existing portable batteries on the market are typically geared for emergency charging. This means that they are either too big to be practical or they don't hold enough charge to be useful everyday. Another issue we've found is that virtually every other battery backup on the market can ONLY be charged via USB and that can be a hassle. You'll need to bring around a USB wall adapter or hunt down a USB port. This inconvenient method of keeping smart phones and other devices charged inspired the creation of BOLT. Our passion for simplicity pushed us to make BOLT the world's smallest battery backup and wall charger combined. BOLT's compact size and 3000mAh battery make it the perfect balance of portability and capacity that will charge your mobile devices ANYWHERE. Dimensions: 70mm x 34mm x 28mm (2.75" x 1.33" x 1.10"). 3000mAh Samsung Li-Ion Battery. Certifications: CE, RoHS, FCC, WEEE. Charge Input: 90-240v A/C (Globally Supported). Charge Output: 5V / 1A. Smooth Rubberized Finish. Status Indicator LEDs. Smart Charge Technology: Automatically Bypasses the Battery when Fully Charged.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Brother P-Touch M Series Tape Cartridge for P-Touch Labelers, 1/2w, Black on White</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/EAC8D2CF-12CE-4C95-997D-0A6E80B8DBE6-140.png" width="140" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">M series non-laminated tape for P-Touch@ label makers.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Comply Tsx-400 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06CC4A04-D04D-4462-85FF-02F9CC80966B-140.png" width="140" height="124" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Delivering amazing comfort through a spherical shape, Comfort Plus Tsx-400 tips have integrated Wax-Guard, preventing wax from entering the sound port, which will diminish sound quality.

The shaft has a comfortable rubber grip that feels great to hold for people of all ages, including children and the elderly. The tip is responsive and glides effortlessly over the glass screen. The Cosmonaut will work on nearly any capacitive touch screen device, including the iPad and Kindle Fire. It does not require special software; it will work wherever your finger works.

The Glif is an iPhone 5 accessory with two primary functions: mounting your iPhone onto a tripod and propping up your iPhone at various angles. Our goal was to create something small, simple, and elegant. But out of this simple design emerges countless uses. Mount your iPhone to a tripod for taking great pictures or making movies. Prop your iPhone up for hands-free FaceTiming or to watch videos. All of that and more in a compact design that is manufactured in America. The Glif is made from recyclable rubberized plastic that feels great and plays nice with your phone, and is small enough to fit snugly in your pocket, purse, or backpack. It has a 1/4"-20 thread that fits any standard tripod or camera mount. The Glif is designed to work with a "naked" (caseless) iPhone and is compatible with the iPhone 5. The Serif is designed to keep your iPhone incredibly secure on the tripod. While the Glif is great for normal use, the Serif will keep your phone safe in more extreme situations. And, when you are not using the Serif, it fits snuggly inside the Glif, making it very compact. Additionally, the Glif+ comes with the Ligature, a simple keyring loop that attaches to the tripod thread on the Glif. Now, you'll have a way to always keep your Glif handy, by attaching it to your keychain, backpack, purse, or anything, really.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Hoodman H-EYEC22 HoodEYE Eyecup for Canon 22mm Cameras</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/32907B99-10BD-4CAE-9B0B-B1EFA0CF4A07-140.png" width="140" height="99" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Eyecup for 22mm Canon 1D,1DsII,&amp;1DsIII</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Joby GorillaPod Hybrid Red</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B90B7AC1-6768-4D34-8C8B-50B0FA839DB0-140.png" width="74" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The perfect companion for your Hybrid or Compact System Camera - such as the SONY NEX series, the Panasonic LUMIX series, or the Olympus PEN series - the GorillaPod Hybrid is the most versatile, portable camera tripod for the demanding, active photographer.

When you're at your desk, there's no faster way to type on your iPhone (or iPod touch, iPad, Android 3.0 phone, or tablet).

Stylish and ultra-thin, the Slim One Keyboard looks gorgeous on your desk. It's also perfect in tight spaces, where you may not have enough room for a big keyboard. MiniRizer stand included: the MiniRizer lifts and tilts your iPhone for easier viewing and tapping. You have 3 angles to choose from: 15 Degrees, 25 Degrees, or 50 Degrees. Nonâ€‘slip rubber feet keep it from sliding around on your desk. Lefty friendly: if you're left-handed, you can move the stand to the left side of the keyboard. If you're used to controlling your iPhone with your left hand, this feels much more natural. Mac version too: for Mac users, and other hard to find symbols are printed right on the keys. Simply hold down Option for the bottom-right characters, or Shift-Option for top-right characters - they even work on the iPhone.

Also connects to other devices: we designed the keyboard to connect wirelessly to your iPhone, but it's actually a standard Bluetooth connection, so it'll work with any device that supports Bluetooth keyboards. That includes the iPod touch, iPad, Macs and PCs, Android 3.0+ smartphones and tablets, Samsung Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry PlayBook, and many more.

This lens system is designed for an iPhone 5/5S and includes a fisheye, wide angle and two different macro lenses to allow you to capture enhanced images and video. It connects to your iPhone 5/5S in just a few seconds, and you can switch lenses simply by flipping it over. The first macro lens applies about 10 times magnification and lets you focus the phone within about 18mm of your subject, while the second macro lens applies about 15 times magnification and lets you focus within about 12mm of your subject. To access either macro lens, simply unscrew and remove the wide-angle or fisheye lens. Meanwhile, by using the fisheye lens you can capture approximately a 180-degree field of view. The wide angle lens provides approximately double that of the iPhone's standard field of view. This lens system is also built to stand up to long-term use. The olloclip uses precision ground glass multi-element optics for the lenses. The barrels are made from aircraft-grade aluminum using a CNC machine and then anodized. The iPhone 5/5S attachment is made from a soft plastic material that ensures a secure fit every time to your phone. And you can use the lenses in combination with any apps that utilize the rear-facing camera.

All you need is a standard flash/strobe unit and an off-camera cord (or other remote triggering method). The Orbis is handheld or bracket mountable (bracket sold seperately) so neither impedes your camera system's functionality nor relies on the fragile hotshoe connection. The Orbis was designed to give passionate photographers an edge; by enabling you to quickly and easily take beautifully lit photographs, and to get the most out of your equipment.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Peak Design Capture Camera Clip PEAKCAMCLIP</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A3E4A343-DF1B-40AE-86D1-90935E11F136-140.png" width="140" height="72" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The Capture Camera Clip System is a new way for active photographers to carry their camera - by rigidly clipping it to any strap or belt on your existing gear. The product consists of a compact, ultralight aluminum "chassis" that securely clamps down onto your belt, backpack strap, messenger bag strap, climbing harness, life vest, or other garments you already own. A small aluminum "camera connection plate" screws into the tripod mount on your camera. The plate allows your camera to slide and lock into the chassis, letting you securely carry your bulky SLR camera with ease. Furthermore, Capture keeps your camera readily accessible with it's "quick release lock." With the press of a button, you can slide your camera out of the chassis, snap a photo, and click it back into place. Whether you're hiking, biking, skiing, climbing mountains, or just snapping pictures at a family gathering, the versatility of Capture will revolutionize the way you transport and handle your camera.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Peak Design MICROplate</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/9E80C2C8-FAA1-4116-BAFD-C3F95A796CAC-140.png" width="140" height="102" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The Peak Design DUALplate allows you to take your camera out of Capture and put it directly into your Manfrotto RC2 or ARCA-type tripod head - no disassembly necessary.

By employing a high quality omni-directional condenser capsule the smartLav picks up sound equally from all around the microphone, allowing for versatility when mounting and ensuring a high degree of user-friendly operation. A foam pop shield is supplied to minimize wind noise and vocal plosives (hard â€˜bâ€™, â€˜tâ€™ and â€˜pâ€™ sounds), as well as a durable mounting clip with in-built cable management. The smartLav is compatible with any audio app that accepts input from the headset connection, however it has been designed to pair perfectly with RÃ˜DEâ€™s RÃ˜DE Rec app for Apple iOS devices.

There is also a 2-step high pass filter with 0 and 80Hz settings, letting you minimize the impact of low frequency hum, camera motor noise, and similar distractions.

This means that photographers can choose among three different size grid spots using this small, lightweight system. Measuring 3.6" x 1.2" (92mm x 30mm), and weighing just 3.5oz (100 grams) with the included strap, the Rogue Grid fits easily into any photographer's bag. How does it work? The Rogue Grid's unique design utilizes precision-molded honeycomb grids that can be used independently for the 25Ëš or the 45Ëš spots, or stacked together to create the 16Ëš spot. Because the honeycomb cells align precisely using the integrated alignment features, they can be stacked without creating unwanted shadows and reducing light output. When not being used, the stacked grids store conveniently inside the bezel. What does the light look like from a honeycomb grid? When attached to a light source, a honeycomb grid creates a spot of light with a gradual fall-off useful for adding dimension and depth to an image, or for highlighting important features. The angle of the grid determines the size of the spot projected forward, with smaller degree grids producing smaller spots, and larger angles producing larger spots. How are honeycomb grids typically used? Grids are often used on off-camera flashes as hair lights in portraiture, or for background or accent lights anytime a photographer is interested in highlighting a portion of an image for dramatic effect. When attached to an off-camera flash, grids help draw attention to an object, texture, or color, and can help to create a desired atmosphere or mood in an image. Easy to attach, and Includes a Pouch The Rogue Grid securely attaches to almost all standard shoe mount flashes using the included adjustable Rogue Tension Strap. Also included is a durable nylon storage pouch that accommodates both the Rogue Grid and grid strap.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sena 8268C8 Wallet Book Leather Case for iPhone 5 &amp; 5s - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Pebble Red</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/88FDB569-9D8C-4960-B87D-821ABCABE806-140.png" width="140" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The Wallet Book combines your iPhone 5 with a premium leather designer wallet.
