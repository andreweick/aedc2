Highly regarded as a master of light, both natural and artificial, Joe continues to create stunning imagery all over the world. Much sought after as a photographer, lecturer, and teacher, Joe educates and inspires shooters of all types—pros, hobbyists and beginners—with The Language of Light. In this DVD set, Joe shares almost 30 years worth of field knowledge, instruction, and philosophy about using light as a powerful tool of visual communication. He fully explores and explains different lighting techniques, and goes well beyond the "how" all the way through the "why," of using light. Small flash, hard light, soft light, light with color, light in the studio, and light on location are all dissected and explained. You see and hear all about the f-stops, shutter speeds, lenses and light shaping tools, and you are taken further into the reasons why a one lighting approach is better than another for certain scenes, faces or groups. All along the way, Joe offers tips, tricks and solutions that can only be gained from 30 years with a camera to your eye. Sit back, relax and enjoy as this legendary shooter takes you on a fast paced, humorous, and always informative journey about how to speak with light.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">DVD: Strobist: Lighting in Layers with David Hobby (7 DVD Set) new for 2011</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/36B933ED-EA71-495A-A828-71C1B68B6DC3-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Photographer David Hobby of Strobist.com follows up his Lighting Seminar DVD Set (May 2008) with Lighting in Layers, a series of real-world, behind-the-scenes assignments lit entirely with small flashes.

Indie Game: The Movie is the first feature documentary film about making video games. It looks specifically at the underdogs of the video game industry, indie game developers, who sacrifice money, health and sanity to realize their lifelong dreams of sharing their visions with the world. After two years of painstaking work, designer Edmund McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes await the release of their first major game for Xbox, Super Meat Boy-the adventures of a skinless boy in search of his girlfriend, who is made of bandages. At PAX, a major video-game expo, developer Phil Fish unveils his highly anticipated, four-years-in-the-making FEZ. Jonathan Blow considers beginning a new game after creating Braid, one of the highest-rated games of all time. Four developers, three games, and one ultimate goal- to express oneself through a video game. Indie Game: The Movie is about the creative process and putting yourself out there through your work. It's a journey many filmmakers, creators, artists, entrepreneurs - many people, can relate to in the digital era.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Sound of Music</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/936E966D-D5B9-4B89-A3BA-AD92E205A960-140.png" width="110" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Experience the world's most beloved family film as never before with this 3-disc 45th Anniversary Edition of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's® The Sound of Music, Winner of five 1965 Academy Awards®, including Best Picture!<br /><br />In this true-life story, Julie Andrews lights up the screen as Maria, a spirited young woman who leaves the convent to bring love and music to the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Tillman Story</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D429E08E-772E-4AF2-89B7-9564CF192DE4-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Pat Tillman gave up his professional football career to join the Army Rangers in 2002—and became an instant symbol of patriotic fervor and unflinching duty. But the truth about Pat Tillman is far more complex, and ultimately more heroic, than the caricature created by the media. And when the government tried to turn his death into war propaganda, they took on the wrong family. From her home in the Santa Cruz mountains, Pat’s mother, Dannie Tillman, led the family’s crusade to reveal the truth beneath the mythology of their son’s life and death. Featuring candid and revelatory interviews with Pat’s fellow soldiers as well as his family, Amir Bar-Lev’s emotional and insightful film not only shines a light on the shady aftermath of Pat’s death and calls to task the entire chain of command but also examines themes as timeless as the notion of heroism itself.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">To Rome With Love</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F6EF7359-B817-4FEF-972D-BAD4A4170B8F-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Romance!

Beginning with the 1993 murders, the film chronicles the 18-year fight to prove the innocence of the West Memphis Three; Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, incarcerated for an alleged Satanic ritual killing the convicted men, and their supporters worldwide, maintain they did not commit. With Echols on death row and Baldwin and Misskelley serving life sentences, PARADISE LOST 3 examines a horrifying crime with fresh insights that only the passage of time can provide. Facts are reexamined, new evidence is revealed, and new suspects are scrutinized. With an extraordinary perspective of three films spanning nearly two decades, PARADISE LOST 3 is a provocative examination of American justice and a celebration of the power of cinema to effect social change.

Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is a director whose film-and life-is collapsing around him. An early working title for the film was La Bella Confusione (The Beautiful Confusion), and Fellini's masterpiece is exactly that: a shimmering dream, a circus, and a magic act. The Criterion Collection is proud to present the 1963 Academy Award® winner for Best Foreign-Language Film-one of the most written about, talked about, and imitated movies of all time-in a beautifully restored new digital transfer. Disc two features Fellini's rarely seen first film for television, Fellini: A Director's Notebook (1969). Produced by Peter Goldfarb, this imagined documentary of Fellini is a kaleidoscope of unfinished projects, all of which provide a fascinating and candid window into the director's unique and creative process.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">La Dolce Vita</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/67ACEA52-3AF8-4222-9BC2-DD6D219EEFA1-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Federico Fellini</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">LA DOLCE VITA</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">La Strada</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/19658A97-B35B-4B0B-9680-E238F61F125A-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Federico Fellini</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Giuletta Masina, Anthony Quinn, Richard Basehart.

Viewers will learn how to optimize exposure and maximize detail, minimize noise, and create the best images possible. This workshop begins with an overview of key exposure concepts, then discusses various exposure modes and some advanced concepts and techniques to help viewers master the concepts and practice of photographic exposure. It also covers some post-processing techniques related to exposure and includes some real-world examples that review core exposure concepts.<br /><br />Experienced instructor Tim Grey presents more than 3 hours of exceptional quality video tutorials, complete with lesson files, assessment quizzes, and review materials. The video is wrapped in a unique interface that allows the viewer to jump to any topic and also bookmark individual sections for later review.

It’s a way of building sites and applications that requires a fundamental shift in approach. From planning to development, every aspect of building for the web is affected.<br />This video course starts by explaining the three primary components of responsive design: fluid layouts, media queries and responsive images. With a firm understanding of those in place, we branch out and explore how responsive design impacts workflow, how to maintain the hierarchy of content, how to use feature detection to enhance the experience, how to organize your JavaScript to play along nicely, how to optimize responsive sites for performance—and more.<br />Course objectives &amp; goals: This course arms its students with the skills necessary to start building quality responsive sites today. By the end of the course, students will know how to: Use fluid layouts, media queries and fluid images to create responsive layoutsUse responsive image techniques to serve appropriately sized images to a variety of devicesEnsure that the hierarchy of content is preserved across screen sizesEnhance the functionality of your site with feature detectionImprove the performance of your site and avoid becoming another example of "fat" responsive designAdjust your existing workflow to better accomodate multi-device design and developmentDetermine what devices to test on and how<br />Course Requirements: To get the most out of this course, you'll need your favorite code editor and ideally a couple of devices to test on. If you don't have a tablet and phone for testing, then you'll want to get ahold of a simulator or use one of the many device testing services online to follow along. You could, theoretically, follow along by resizing your browser, but I highly recommend against it—you'll get much more out of it by seeing how things behave on different devices.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Side by Side</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/3A7A2AE8-BF6D-4478-8ED9-0CC943861D35-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Christopher Kenneally</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Join Keanu Reeves on a tour of the past and the future of filmmaking in SIDE BY SIDE.

A grown-up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry-eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup — Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) — who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record-breaking $50 million in its first week of release.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A3C1A8D7-9DB5-4BE8-990D-82D233C9A9C8-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Steven Spielberg</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is no ordinary archeologist. When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby-trapped gauntlet (complete with an over-sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman), who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he's a soft-spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical-minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy's old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a "history" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action-packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate), Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), as well as a short-lived TV-series "prequel."</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Lincoln</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/77E00929-867D-4923-8691-72889C0BA5D2-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Steven Spielberg</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Capturing the danger and excitement of political intrigue, Steven Spielberg's Lincoln chronicles the final four months in the life of the man regarded as America's greatest President.

With the Civil War nearing conclusion, President Lincoln fights to convince a fractious Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment that will change the course of history. Facing fierce opposition, he wages a battle of strategy, persuasion, and political muscle to build a coalition out of his team of rivals.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Build a Network Application with Node</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B64D8AF3-C31A-46D2-9723-A55DA4B4C5B3-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Joe Stanco</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Die Another Day</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1BC545F7-6376-4C3A-BBDE-3858F3ECDBD4-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Lee Tamahori</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">When his top-secret mission is sabotaged, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) finds himself captured by theenemy, abandoned by MI6 and stripped of his 00-license.
