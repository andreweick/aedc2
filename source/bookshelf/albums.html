These performances were among the group's earliest recordings and helped catapult them into the forefront of specialists in this demanding repertoire. The Allegri became a favorite back in the 1970s, a sort of choral equivalent of Albinoni's Adagio, in which repetition serves as the driving force. The Tallis Scholars give it welcome variety through spatial placement in a large church and their colorful singing. Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli is one of that great composer's finest works. Its mastery of polyphony while clarifying the text is said to have convinced the Church to withhold its impending ban on polyphonic church music. The group sounds larger than its 21 members because of the acoustics, the clear diction of the Scholars, and the power of their singing, always transparent and involved. They use female sopranos instead of boys' voices, so there's more heft and color than we often hear from early-music groups. Vivid engineering makes the CD even more attractive. —Dan Davis</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Bach: Goldberg Variations</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E38C363F-C309-4482-80FD-A5F36C9E3EEC-140.png" width="140" height="123" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Listen to the music first! Perahia's booklet essay is a dry musicological treatise concerned with technical aspects of Bach's music. His performance, on the other hand, is filled with life and excitement. The kind of overt virtuosity heard in some of these variations has been a rarity in Perahia's recordings, but it shows how wide a range he intends to cover in his playing of this masterpiece. Unlike Glenn Gould, who is most listeners' touchstone for piano performances of the Goldbergs, Perahia takes Bach's necessary repeats and uses them as occasions for adventure, varying not only the emphases, but also the actual notes. This kind of embellishment in repeats was expected in Bach's time, but it's rare in ours. Also, taking the repeats doubles the length of the piece, making it a larger and more affecting experience—as long as the performer manages to keep those repeats alive, which Perahia certainly does. His playing of the famous 25th variation is deeply affecting without the faintest trace of sentimentality. The way he varies Bach's moods from moment to moment is extremely effective. This is, in short, one of the great recordings of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations. With Vladimir Feltsman's similarly revelatory performance currently out of the catalogs, Perahia's is probably the best piano version available. It's also one of his best recordings. —Leslie Gerber</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Bach: The Art of the Fugue</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/0A52E638-B0CC-4A3E-810F-199F611836A3-140.png" width="140" height="123" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Bach: Works For Trumpet</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D77D17DD-D1C7-4C2A-A099-809D6EE46504-140.png" width="140" height="123" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">CD W/Alison Balsom, Colin Carey, Alistair Ross, Alina Ibra</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Chopin: Piano Sonatas Nos. 2 &amp; 3 ~ Uchida</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D3985D87-E54D-42E7-B94B-E44236174EB1-140.png" width="140" height="123" /></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">J.S.

His fellow Texas native Edie Brickell initially burst onto the national scene in the late 80s fronting the New Bohemians, and has since carved out an iconoclastic solo career that's solidified her reputation as compelling singer and a songwriter of rare insight. Although these new musical partners have already built widely-respected individual bodies of work, their inaugural duo effort is a substantial departure, as a well as a creative milestone, for both artists. Love Has Come for You offers 13 eloquently rootsy Martin/Brickell compositions that combine the former's inventive, expressive five-string banjo work with the latter's heart-tugging vocals and vivid, detail-rich lyrics. Produced by legendary musician and producer, Peter Asher, and featuring the guest stylings of Esperanza Spalding, Waddy Wachtel, Nickel Creek alumni Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins, as well as the Steep Canyon Rangers, Love Has Come For You is playful, spacious, and irresistibly accessible.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Crime of the Century</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D73104BE-13D3-4286-8472-CD9F72131399-140.png" width="140" height="123" /></div><span class="creator">Supertramp</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Steering their art-rock origins into new pop territory, Supertramp made their first strike with this 1974 Top 40 LP.
